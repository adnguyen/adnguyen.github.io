	<p>About me: I am a 4th year PhD candidate at the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/">University of Vermont</a> . My training is guided by the two best mentors in the world: <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/homepage.html">Dr. Nick Gotelli</a>, who studies the community ecology and biogeography of carnivorous pitcher plants and ants; <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/?Page=faculty/cahan.php&SM=facultysubmenu.html">Dr. Sara Helms Cahan</a> who studies the evolution of social structure. My dissertation has combined the ecological and evolutionary approaches of my co-advisors with my own interest in molecular biology to investigate mechanisms of temperature adaptation in ants. </p>
	
	<h2>Why do I study biology?</h2>
	<p>Life fascinates me...so my greatest aspiration is to understand every facet of it. More specifically, I aim to understand the forces that shape diversity at all levels of biological organization from genes to ecosystems.  </p>
