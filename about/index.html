	About me: I am a 4th year graduate student  at the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/">University of Vermont</a> 
	
	<h3>Life fascinates me...</h3>
	<p>So my professional goal is to understand every facet of it. More specifically, I want to know what forces shape diversity at all levels of biological organization from genes to ecosystems.  </p>
