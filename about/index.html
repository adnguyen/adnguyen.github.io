	<p>About me: I was not always fascinated by nature. As a kid, I'd play outside for hours and hours but never noticed the beauty of nature. This continued through college (Drexel University) until I took an Evolution course that helped me appreciate biological diversity and how evolutionary processes can shape that diversity. Up until this course, I was used to memorizing facts about molecules and cells, but through the lens of evolution, these facts became fun to think about. For example, are viruses really living? How does cancer emerge? What is the unit of selection? Why do proteins look a certain way? Not only did I ask questions at lower levels, but I've always been interested at higher levels too. Such as: Why do some behaviors exist and not others? Why are we altruistic? What motivates human behavior?	Also, should we really separate out levels of biological organization? How are they related? </p>
	<p>It turns out, ants are a good model to explore almost all of these questions in biology from genes to ecosystems because many genomes are now available, they're social, and they provide critical ecosystem services. I decided to pursue a PhD in 2012 and now I'm a 5th year PhD candidate at the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/">University of Vermont</a>. For my dissertation, I'm exploring how temperature is a selective force on ant characteristics from where they live (abundance and distribution) to how they function (physiology) and how different levels of biological organization are related. </p>
