	<h2>Temperature adaptation in a changing environment...</h2>
	<p> Many organisms face extinction and/or range shifts to future climate change unless they are able to stay in place by acclimating or adapting. Ants are a great taxonomic group to study species responses to climate change, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with variable environments. </p>

	<figcaption> Study system: Common woodland ants (genus <i>Aphaenogaster</i>) Photo by <a href="http://www.alexanderwild.com/">Alex Wild</a>. The queen is front and center! She lays the majority of eggs within the colony, while other small ants in the frame, known as workers, perform all the grunt work from taking care of babies to finding food.

	<h3>Research Objective</h3>
	<p>One way to understand species vulnerability or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to determine how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main objective of my dissertation. For this work, I investigate how a group of ecologically important North American forest ant species copes with thermally stressful environments.  </p>
