	<h2>Temperature adaptation in a changing environment...</h2>
	<p> Many organisms face extinction and/or range shifts to future climate change unless they are able to stay in place (acclimate and/or adapt). Ants are a great taxonomic group to study species responses to climate change, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with variable environments. </p>

	<h3>Research Objective</h3>
	<p>One way to understand species vulnerabilities or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to determine how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main objective of my dissertation. </p>
	
	<h3> Dissertation work to date </h3>
	<p> My dissertation work investigates how a clade of ecologically important North
American forest ant species copes with thermally stressful environments. I have found
that the expansion of these ants into divergent habitats has been accompanied by shifts in
heat tolerance and underlying stress resistance mechanisms.</p>
