	<h2>Temperature adaptation in a changing environment...</h2>
	
	<h3> Overview </h3>
	<p> Welcome to my research page! My goal in life is to understand the forces that shape diversity, from genes to ecosystems. A great taxonomic group to study this are ants, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with thermally stressful environments. How species cope with variable environmental conditions is critical for understanding how species will respond to future climate changes.</p>
