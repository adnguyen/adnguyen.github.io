	<h2>Temperature adaptation in a changing environment...</h2>
	<p> Welcome to my research page! My goal in life is to understand the forces that shape diversity, from genes to ecosystems. A great taxonomic group to study this are ants, since they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and have been able to cope with thermally stressful environments. How species cope with variable environmental conditions is critical for understanding how species will respond to future climate change.  </p>
	
	<h3>Research approaches</h3>
	<p>One way to understand species vulnerabilities or resiliency to pending temperature shifts is to determine how different species have historically adapted to changing climates, which is the main objective of my dissertation at the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/">University of Vermont</a> </p>
