Career Profile
---------

I am a data-driven biologist with six years of relevant experience in biostatistics in addition to five years of PhD training. Over the past four years, I have excelled as a remote worker as a statistical analyst at a non-profit in the field of regulatory toxicology and worked for two years as a research scientist in an academic lab applying statistical techniques to understand seasonal timing in agricultural pests. The culmination of my experiences has led me to be skilled in constructing narratives from data to address real world problems.   

My go-to tool is R (RStudio), where I have the most experience in data wrangling (cleaning, parsing, transforming), data analysis, simulations, and data visualization. I also have familiarity with Unix and Git version control. 

Career Highlights 
---------   

* Served as a statistical lead and coordinator for projects in collaboration with the US EPA and US FDA   
* Flexible and quick learner as exemplified in diverse professional experiences over the past 11 years    
* Excellent scientific communicator as exemplified in 11 peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations
