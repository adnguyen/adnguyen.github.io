# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello, welcome to my demo notebook. The purpose of this notebook is to log ideas I've explored. It'll be useful for me, and hopefully, also for you!

The themes I've explored include causal inference, bayesian stats, frequentist stats, decision making under uncertainty, and function-valued traits.
