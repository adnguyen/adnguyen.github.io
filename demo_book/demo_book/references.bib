	abstract = {Many medical journals, including JAMA, restrict the use of causal language to the reporting of randomized clinical trials. Although well-conducted randomized clinical trials remain the preferred approach for answering causal questions, methods for observational studies have advanced such that causal interpretations of the results of well-conducted observational studies may be possible when strong assumptions hold. Furthermore, observational studies may be the only practical source of information for answering some questions about the causal effects of medical or policy interventions, can support the study of interventions in populations and settings that reflect practice, and can help identify interventions for further experimental investigation. Identifying opportunities for the appropriate use of causal language when describing observational studies is important for communication in medical journals.A structured approach to whether and how causal language may be used when describing observational studies would enhance the communication of research goals, support the assessment of assumptions and design and analytic choices, and allow for more clear and accurate interpretation of results. Building on the extensive literature on causal inference across diverse disciplines, we suggest a framework for observational studies that aim to provide evidence about the causal effects of interventions based on 6 core questions: what is the causal question; what quantity would, if known, answer the causal question; what is the study design; what causal assumptions are being made; how can the observed data be used to answer the causal question in principle and in practice; and is a causal interpretation of the analyses tenable?Adoption of the proposed framework to identify when causal interpretation is appropriate in observational studies promises to facilitate better communication between authors, reviewers, editors, and readers. Practical implementation will require cooperation between editors, authors, and reviewers to operationalize the framework and evaluate its effect on the reporting of empirical research.},

	abstract = {We present the GPCERF R package, which employs a novel Bayesian approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to estimate the causal exposure-response function (CERF) for continuous exposures, along with associated uncertainties. R packages that target causal effects under a binary exposure setting exist (e.g., Ho et al., 2011), as well as in the continuous exposure setting (e.g., Khoshnevis et al., 2023). However, they often rely on a separate resampling stage to quantify uncertainty of the estimates. GPCERF provides a two-step end-to-end solution for causal inference with continuous exposures that is equipped with automatic and efficient uncertainty quantification. During the first step (the design phase), the algorithm searches for optimal hyperparameters (using the exposures and covariates) that achieve optimal covariate balance in the induced pseudo-population, i.e., that the correlation between the exposure and each covariate is close to zero. The selected hyperparameters are then used in the second step (the analysis phase) to estimate the CERF on the balanced data set and its associated uncertainty using two different types of GPs: a standard GP and a nearest-neighbor GP (nnGP). The standard GP offers high accuracy in estimating CERF but is also computationally intensive. The nnGP is a computationally efficient approximation of the standard GP and is well-suited for the analysis of large-scale datasets.},

	abstract = {Sample size derivation is a crucial element of planning any confirmatory trial. The required sample size is typically derived based on constraints on the maximal acceptable Type I error rate and minimal desired power. Power depends on the unknown true effect and tends to be calculated either for the smallest relevant effect or a likely point alternative. The former might be problematic if the minimal relevant effect is close to the null, thus requiring an excessively large sample size, while the latter is dubious since it does not account for the a priori uncertainty about the likely alternative effect. A Bayesian perspective on sample size derivation for a frequentist trial can reconcile arguments about the relative a priori plausibility of alternative effects with ideas based on the relevance of effect sizes. Many suggestions as to how such âhybridâ approaches could be implemented in practice have been put forward. However, key quantities are often defined in subtly different ways in the literature. Starting from the traditional entirely frequentist approach to sample size derivation, we derive consistent definitions for the most commonly used hybrid quantities and highlight connections, before discussing and demonstrating their use in sample size derivation for clinical trials.},

Current GPS methods allow estimation of the dose-response relationship between a single continuous exposure and an outcome. However, in many real-world settings, there are multiple exposures occurring simultaneously that could be causally related to the outcome. We propose a multivariate GPS method (mvGPS) that allows estimation of a dose-response surface that relates the joint distribution of multiple continuous exposure variables to an outcome. The method involves generating weights under a multivariate normality assumption on the exposure variables. Focusing on scenarios with two exposure variables, we show via simulation that the mvGPS method can achieve balance across sets of confounders that may differ for different exposure variables and reduces bias of the treatment effect estimates under a variety of data generating scenarios. We apply the mvGPS method to an analysis of the joint effect of two types of intervention strategies to reduce childhood obesity rates.},

The Bayesian framework offers a unique advantage over the classical framework, especially when incorporating prior information into a new trial with quality external data, such as historical data or another source of co-data. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in regulatory submissions using Bayesian statistics due to its flexibility and ability to provide valuable insights for decision-making, addressing the modern complexity of clinical trials where frequentist trials are inadequate. For regulatory submissions, companies often need to consider the frequentist operating characteristics of the Bayesian analysis strategy, regardless of the design complexity. In particular, the focus is on the frequentist type I error rate and power for all realistic alternatives. This tutorial review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of Bayesian statistics in sample size determination, control of type I error rate, multiplicity adjustments, external data borrowing, etc., in the regulatory environment of clinical trials. Fundamental concepts of Bayesian sample size determination and illustrative examples are provided to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and statisticians seeking to develop more complex and innovative designs.},

	abstract = {Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without oncogenic driver mutations is considered to have a poor prognosis, although recent therapeutic progress. This study aims to assess the real-life integration of palliative care (PC) and the intensity of end-of-life (EOL) care for this population.
Methods
This was an observational cohort study of decedent patients from metastatic NSCLC without oncogenic driver mutations over the period 01/2018 to 12/2022, treated in first line with immunotherapy +/- chemotherapy. We analysed PC integration and aggressiveness criteria of EOL care in the last month before death: systemic anti-cancer treatment administration, emergency room visits, intensive care unit admission, hospitalization, hospitalization durationâ¯{\textgreater}â¯14â¯days, and hospital death.
Results
Among 149 patients, 75 (50â¯\%) met the PC team at least once, and the median time from the first encounter to death was 2.3â¯months. In the last month before death, at least one criterion of aggressive EOL care was present for 97 patients (70â¯\%). For patients with PC useâ¯{\textless}â¯30â¯days and for patients with PC useâ¯{\textless}â¯90â¯days before death, there were significant changes: increase in the frequency of systemic anti-cancer treatment (respectively 51.1â¯\% vs 20â¯\%; pâ¯{\textless}â¯0.001 and 58.7â¯\% vs 6.2â¯\%; pâ¯{\textless}â¯0.001); decrease in hospitalization lastingâ¯{\textgreater}â¯14â¯days (respectively 30â¯\% vs 7â¯\%; pâ¯=â¯0.001 and 36â¯\% vs 6.2â¯\%; pâ¯=â¯0.018) and in death hospitalisation (respectively 66â¯\% and 18â¯\%; pâ¯{\textless}â¯0.001 and 58.7â¯\% and 10.3â¯\%; pâ¯{\textless}â¯0.001). After adjusting for the factors tested, patients with no PC or late PC use in the last month before death or in the last three month before death, the odds ratio (OR) remained significantly greater than 1 (respectively ORâ¯=â¯3.97 [1.70; 9.98]; pâ¯=â¯0.001 and ORâ¯=â¯23.1 [5.21â177.0], pâ¯{\textless}â¯0.0001).
Conclusion
PC is still insufficiently integrated for patients with NSCL cancer. Cancer centres should monitor key indicators such as PC use and aggressiveness criteria of EOL care.},

	abstract = {Aim and objectives To present our experience of a nursing telephone consultation service, describing patient and caregiver requests, and outlining ensuing nursing or medical interventions. Background Recently, there has been an increase in the use of telephone consultation for cancer patients. However, there is still limited data on the characteristics of this type of service and on the nature of the interventions carried out. Design and methods In this observational retrospective study, we evaluated the phone calls made over a 6-month period by patients or caregivers to the early palliative care team of a cancer institute. Information regarding telephone calls (frequency, reason and management) was systematically collected by a nursing case manager. The study complies with the STROBE checklist File S1. Results 171 patients used the service, for a total of 323 phone calls. The majority (80.8\%) were from patients followed at the outpatient clinic and the most common requests were for pain management (38.4\%) and for updates on the clinical situation (23.8\%). Other frequent requests were for medication management (18.9\%) and scheduling (18.3\%). 210 of the 323 phone calls were handled by the nurse, while 22 were managed in collaboration with a physician. An 87.6\% effectiveness in telephone management was observed. Conclusion The overall use of the phone service was higher for early palliative care patients. The majority of phone calls were effectively handled by the nursing case manager. Relevance to clinical practice An effective and feasible nurse-led telephone follow-up of early palliative care patients with advanced cancer could improve their care experience. Specifically, it could impact on patients and families improving quality of life and symptom control securing access to timely care without travel or additional cost.It can also improve continuity of care, adherence to oncological treatments and minimise acute care visits.},

	abstract = {Objective The positive impact of early palliative care interventions in advanced cancer patients has so far been largely evaluated in randomised controlled trials. This study aimed at providing information on the value of early palliative/supportive care, integrated with standard oncologic care, in a real-life setting.
Methods This was a retrospective observational study of 292 advanced cancer patients consecutively admitted at Carpi Hospital in Modena, Italy, between 2014 and 2017. For the purpose of this analysis, patients were classified into two groups (early and delayed palliative/supportive care patients), and analysed for different clinical indicators. Early and delayed palliative/supportive care were classified according to the time elapsed from advanced cancer diagnosis until palliative/supportive care start.
Results A total of 200 patients (68\%), with at least three visits, were included in the analyses. The frequency of chemotherapy use in the last 60 days of life was 3.4\% and 24.6\% in the early and delayed groups, respectively (adjusted OR=0.1; 95\% CI 0.0 to 0.4; p=0.002). The estimated survival probability at 1 year was 74.5\% (95\% CI 65.0\% to 85.4\%) and 45.5\% (95\% CI 37.6\% to 55.0\%), in the early and delayed groups, respectively. Performance status, pain and all the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale items, assessed at baseline and at 1 to 12 weeks after the intervention, showed significant improvement over time. However, no between-group differences were found with regard to symptom outcomes.
Conclusions An earlier palliative/supportive care intervention was associated with reduced aggressiveness of therapy, in patients receiving community oncology care. Symptom burden was improved by early palliative/supportive care, independently of the timing of patient referral.},

	abstract = {The evidence base demonstrating the benefits of an early focus on palliative care for patients with serious cancers, including advanced lung cancer, is substantial. Early involvement of specialty-trained palliative care clinicians in the care of patients with advanced lung cancer improves patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, and health care delivery, including hospice utilization. Since the time that many of these palliative care trials were conducted, the paradigm of cancer care for many cancers, including lung cancer, has changed dramatically. The majority of patients with advanced lung cancer are now treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies, both of which have had a significant impact on patient's experience and outcomes. With this changing landscape of lung cancer therapeutics, patients are facing new and different challenges, including dealing with novel side effect profiles and coping with greater uncertainty regarding their prognosis. Patients who are living longer with their advanced cancer also struggle with how to address survivorship issues, such as sexual health and exercise, and decision making about end-of-life care. Although palliative care clinicians remain well-suited to address these care needs, they may need to learn new skills to support patients treated with novel therapies. Additionally, as the experience of patients with advanced lung cancer is becoming more varied and individualized, palliative care research interventions and clinical programs should also be delivered in a patient-centered manner to best meet patient's needs and improve their outcomes. Tailored and technology-based palliative care interventions are promising strategies for delivering patient-centered palliative care.},

	abstract = {Purpose
We evaluated the impact of early integrated palliative care (PC) in patients with newly diagnosed lung and GI cancer.
Patients and Methods
We randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed incurable lung or noncolorectal GI cancer to receive either early integrated PC and oncology care (n = 175) or usual care (n = 175) between May 2011 and July 2015. Patients who were assigned to the intervention met with a PC clinician at least once per month until death, whereas those who received usual care consulted a PC clinician upon request. The primary end point was change in quality of life (QOL) from baseline to week 12, per scoring by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scale. Secondary end points included change in QOL from baseline to week 24, change in depression per the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and differences in end-of-life communication.
Results
Intervention patients (v usual care) reported greater improvement in QOL from baseline to week 24 (1.59 v â3.40; P = .010) but not week 12 (0.39 v â1.13; P = .339). Intervention patients also reported lower depression at week 24, controlling for baseline scores (adjusted mean difference, â1.17; 95\% CI, â2.33 to â0.01; P = .048). Intervention effects varied by cancer type, such that intervention patients with lung cancer reported improvements in QOL and depression at 12 and 24 weeks, whereas usual care patients with lung cancer reported deterioration. Patients with GI cancers in both study groups reported improvements in QOL and mood by week 12. Intervention patients versus usual care patients were more likely to discuss their wishes with their oncologist if they were dying (30.2\% v 14.5\%; P = .004).
Conclusion
For patients with newly diagnosed incurable cancers, early integrated PC improved QOL and other salient outcomes, with differential effects by cancer type. Early integrated PC may be most effective if targeted to the specific needs of each patient population.},

	abstract = {Randomized clinical trials have found that, in patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has similar long-term survival and improved perioperative outcomes compared with primary cytoreductive surgery. Despite this, considerable controversy remains about the appropriate use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the proportion of patients who receive this treatment varies considerably among cancer programs in the US.To evaluate the association between high levels of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration and overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.This difference-in-differences comparative effectiveness analysis leveraged differential adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Commission on Cancerâaccredited cancer programs in the US and included women with a diagnosis of stage IIIC and IV epithelial ovarian cancer between January 2004 and December 2015 who were followed up through the end of 2018. The data were analyzed between September 2020 and January 2021.Treatment in a cancer program with high levels of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration (more often than expected based on case mix) or in a program that continued to restrict its use after the 2010 publication of a clinical trial demonstrating the noninferiority of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with primary surgery for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.Case mixâstandardized median overall survival time and 1-year all-cause mortality assessed with a flexible parametric survival model.We identified 19â¯562 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.9 [12.6] years; 3.2\% Asian, 8.0\% Black, 4.8\% Hispanic, 82.5\% White individuals) who were treated in 332 cancer programs that increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 21.7\% in 2004 to 2009 to 42.2\% in 2010 to 2015 and 19â¯737 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.5 [12.6] years; 3.1\% Asian, 7.7\% Black, 6.5\% Hispanic, 81.8\% White individuals) who were treated in 332 programs that marginally increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (20.1\% to 22.5\%) over these periods. The standardized median overall survival times improved by similar magnitudes in programs with high (from 31.6 [IQR, 12.3-70.1] to 37.9 [IQR, 17.0-84.9] months; 6.3-month difference; 95\% CI, 4.2-8.3) and low (from 31.4 [IQR, 12.1-67.2] to 36.8 [IQR, 15.0-80.3] months; 5.4-month difference, 95\% CI, 3.5-7.3) use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy after 2010 (difference-in-differences, 0.9 months; 95\% CI, â1.9 to 3.7). One-year mortality declined more in programs with high (from 25.6\% to 19.3\%; risk difference, â5.2\%; 95\% CI, â6.4 to â4.1) than with low (from 24.9\% to 21.8\%; risk difference, â3.2\%, 95\% CI, â4.3 to â2.0) use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (difference-in-differences, â2.1\%; 95\% CI, â3.7 to â0.5).In this comparative effectiveness research study, compared with cancer programs with low use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those with high use had similar improvements in median overall survival and larger declines in short-term mortality.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) accounts for a substantial number of cancer cases in the United States, with a significant prevalence and mortality rate. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has the potential to impact cancer-specific survival among NHL patients by improving access to healthcare services and treatments.
Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of the implementation of the ACA on cancer-specific survival among patients diagnosed with NHL.
Methodology: In this retrospective analysis, we leveraged data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) registry to assess the impact of the ACA on cancer-specific survival among NHL patients. The study covered the years 2000-2020, divided into pre-ACA (2000-2013) and post-ACA (2017-2020) periods, with a three-year washout (2014-2016). Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, we compared Georgia (a non-expansion state) to New Jersey (an expansion state since 2014). We adjusted for patient demographics, income, metropolitan status, disease stage, and treatment modalities. Results: Among 74,762 patients, 56.2\% were in New Jersey (42,005), while 43.8\% were in Georgia (32,757). The pre-ACA period included 32,851 patients (51.7\% in Georgia and 56.7\% in New Jersey), and 27,447 patients were in the post-ACA period (48.3\% in Georgia and 43.4\% in New Jersey). The post-ACA period exhibited a 34\% survival improvement (OR=0.66, 95\% CI 0.58-0.75). ACA implementation was associated with a 16\% survival boost among NHL patients in New Jersey (OR=0.84, 95\% CI 0.74-0.95). Other factors linked to improved survival included surgery (OR=0.86, 95\% CI 0.81-0.91), radiotherapy (OR=0.77, 95\% CI 0.72-0.82), and married status (OR=0.67, 95\% CI 0.64-0.71).
Conclusion: The study underscores the ACA's potential positive impact on cancer-specific survival among NHL patients, emphasizing the importance of healthcare policy interventions in improving patient outcomes.},

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic properties of different sets of run chart rules. A run chart is a line graph of a quality measure over time. The main purpose of the run chart is to detect process improvement or process degradation, which will turn up as non-random patterns in the distribution of data points around the median. Non-random variation may be identified by simple statistical tests including the presence of unusually long runs of data points on one side of the median or if the graph crosses the median unusually few times. However, there is no general agreement on what defines âunusually longâ or âunusually fewâ. Other tests of questionable value are frequently used as well. Three sets of run chart rules (Anhoej, Perla, and Carey rules) have been published in peer reviewed healthcare journals, but these sets differ significantly in their sensitivity and specificity to non-random variation. In this study I investigate the diagnostic values expressed by likelihood ratios of three sets of run chart rules for detection of shifts in process performance using random data series. The study concludes that the Anhoej rules have good diagnostic properties and are superior to the Perla and the Carey rules.},

Propensity score matching (PSM) is a valuable way to control for bias and achieve pseudo-randomization in retrospective observation studies. The purpose of this review is to 1) provide a clear conceptual framework for PSM, 2) recommend how to best report its use in studies, and 3) offer some practical examples of implementation. First, this article covers the concepts behind PSM, discusses its pros and cons, and compares it with other methods of controlling for bias, namely, hard/exact matching and regression analysis. Second, recommendations are given for what to report in a manuscript when PSM is used. Finally, a worked example is provided, which can also serve as a template for the readerâs own studies. A studyâs conclusions are only as strong as its methods. PSM is an invaluable tool for producing rigorous and reproducible results in observational studies. The goal of this article is to give practicing clinical physicians not only a better understanding of PSM and its implications but the ability to implement it for their own studies.

	abstract = {Difference-in-differences is undoubtedly one of the most widely used methods for evaluating the causal effect of an intervention in observational (i.e., nonrandomized) settings. The approach is typically used when pre- and postexposure outcome measurements are available, and one can reasonably assume that the association of the unobserved confounder with the outcome has the same absolute magnitude in the two exposure arms and is constant over time; a so-called parallel trends assumption. The parallel trends assumption may not be credible in many practical settings, for example, if the outcome is binary, a count, or polytomous, as well as when an uncontrolled confounder exhibits nonadditive effects on the distribution of the outcome, even if such effects are constant over time. We introduce an alternative approach that replaces the parallel trends assumption with an odds ratio equi-confounding assumption under which an association between treatment and the potential outcome under no treatment is identified with a well-specified generalized linear model relating the pre-exposure outcome and the exposure. Because the proposed method identifies any causal effect that is conceivably identified in the absence of confounding bias, including nonlinear effects such as quantile treatment effects, the approach is aptly called universal difference-in-differences. We describe and illustrate both fully parametric and more robust semiparametric universal difference-in-differences estimators in a real-world application concerning the causal effects of a Zika virus outbreak on birth rate in Brazil.

	abstract = {This paper deals with inference and prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one also has the choice of using a candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each target series. Starting with a structural model for time series, we use Bayesian tools for model ï¬tting, prediction and feature selection, thus extending some recent works along these lines for the univariate case. The Bayesian paradigm in this multivariate setting helps the model avoid overï¬tting, as well as captures correlations among multiple target time series with various state components. The model provides needed ï¬exibility in selecting a diï¬erent set of components and available predictors for each target series. The cyclical component in the model can handle large variations in the short term, which may be caused by external shocks. Extensive simulations were run to investigate properties such as estimation accuracy and performance in forecasting. This was followed by an empirical study with one-step-ahead prediction on the max log return of a portfolio of stocks that involve four leading ï¬nancial institutions. Both the simulation studies and the extensive empirical study conï¬rm that this multivariate model outperforms three other benchmark models, viz. a model that treats each target series as independent, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with regression (ARIMAX), and the multivariate ARIMAX (MARIMAX) model.},

	abstract = {Missing data is a common challenge when analyzing epidemiological data, and imputation is often used to address this issue. Here, we investigate the scenario where a covariate used in an analysis has missingness and will be imputed. There are recommendations to include the outcome from the analysis model in the imputation model for missing covariates, but it is not necessarily clear if this recommendation always holds and why this is sometimes true. We examine deterministic imputation (i.e. single imputation with fixed values) and stochastic imputation (i.e. single or multiple imputation with random values) methods and their implications for estimating the relationship between the imputed covariate and the outcome. We mathematically demonstrate that including the outcome variable in imputation models is not just a recommendation but a requirement to achieve unbiased results when using stochastic imputation methods. Moreover, we dispel common misconceptions about deterministic imputation models and demonstrate why the outcome should not be included in these models. This article aims to bridge the gap between imputation in theory and in practice, providing mathematical derivations to explain common statistical recommendations. We offer a better understanding of the considerations involved in imputing missing covariates and emphasize when it is necessary to include the outcome variable in the imputation model.},

	abstract = {In longitudinal observational studies with a time-to-event outcome, a common objective in causal analysis is to estimate the causal survival curve under hypothetical intervention scenarios within the study cohort. The g-formula is a particularly useful tool for this analysis. To enhance the traditional parametric g-formula approach, we developed a more adaptable Bayesian g-formula estimator. This estimator facilitates both longitudinal predictive and causal inference. It incorporates Bayesian additive regression trees in the modeling of the time-evolving generative components, aiming to mitigate bias due to model misspecification. Specifically, we introduce a more general class of g-formulas for discrete survival data. These formulas can incorporate the longitudinal balancing scores, which serve as an effective method for dimension reduction and are vital when dealing with an expanding array of time-varying confounders. The minimum sufficient formulation of these longitudinal balancing scores is linked to the nature of treatment regimes, whether static or dynamic. For each type of treatment regime, we provide posterior sampling algorithms, which are grounded in the Bayesian additive regression trees framework. We have conducted simulation studies to illustrate the empirical performance of our proposed Bayesian g-formula estimators, and to compare them with existing parametric estimators. We further demonstrate the practical utility of our methods in real-world scenarios using data from the Yale New Haven Health System's electronic health records.},

In recent years, several methods have been developed under the RCM to estimate causal effects in time series settings. None of these makes use of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, which are instead very common in the econometrics literature.

We ï¬rst formalise the assumptions enabling the deï¬nition, the estimation and the attribution of the effect to the intervention.

	abstract = {Background
              In September 2014, as part of a national initiative to increase access to liaison psychiatry services, the liaison psychiatry services at Bristol Royal Infirmary received new investment of Â£250 000 per annum, expanding its availability from 40 to 98 h per week. The long-term impact on patient outcomes and costs, of patients presenting to the emergency department with self-harm, is unknown.


              Aims
              To assess the long-term impact of the investment on patient care outcomes and costs, of patients presenting to the emergency department with self-harm.


              Method
              Monthly data for all self-harm emergency department attendances between 1 September 2011 and 30 September 2017 was modelled using Bayesian structural time series to estimate expected outcomes in the absence of expanded operating hours (the counterfactual). The difference between the observed and expected trends for each outcome were interpreted as the effects of the investment.


              Results
              Over the 3 years after service expansion, the mean number of self-harm attendances increased 13\%. Median waiting time from arrival to psychosocial assessment was 2 h shorter (18.6\% decrease, 95\% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) â30.2\% to â2.8\%), there were 45 more referrals to other agencies (86.1\% increase, 95\% BCI 60.6\% to 110.9\%) and a small increase in the number of psychosocial assessments (11.7\% increase, 95\% BCI â3.4\% to 28.5\%) per month. Monthly mean net hospital costs were Â£34 more per episode (5.3\% increase, 95\% BCI â11.6\% to 25.5\%).


              Conclusions
              Despite annual increases in emergency department attendances, investment was associated with reduced waiting times for psychosocial assessment and more referrals to other agencies, with only a small increase in cost per episode.},

	abstract = {Researchers are often faced with evaluating the effect of a policy or program that was simultaneously initiated across an entire population of units at a single point in time, and its effects over the targeted population can manifest at any time period afterwards. In the presence of data measured over time, Bayesian time series models have been used to impute what would have happened after the policy was initiated, had the policy not taken place, in order to estimate causal effects. However, the considerations regarding the definition of the target estimands, the underlying assumptions, the plausibility of such assumptions, and the choice of an appropriate model have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish useful estimands for the evaluation of large-scale policies. We discuss that imputation of missing potential outcomes relies on an assumption which, even though untestable, can be partially evaluated using observed data. We illustrate an approach to evaluate this key causal assumption and facilitate model elicitation based on data from the time interval before policy initiation and using classic statistical techniques. As an illustration, we study the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a US federal intervention aiming to improve health outcomes for patients with pneumonia, acute myocardial infraction, or congestive failure admitted to a hospital. We evaluate the effect of the HRRP on population mortality among the elderly across the US and in four geographic subregions, and at different time windows. We find that the HRRP increased mortality from pneumonia and acute myocardial infraction across at least one geographical region and time horizon, and is likely to have had a detrimental effect on public health.},

When using observational data, estimating those effects requires adjustment for confounding. However, conventional regression methods cannot appropriately adjust for confounding in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback. In contrast, estimators derived from Robins's g-formula may correctly adjust for confounding even if treatment-confounder feedback exists. The package gfoRmula implements in R one such estimator: the parametric g-formula. This estimator can be used to estimate the effects of binary or continuous time-varying treatments as well as contrasts defined by static or dynamic, deterministic, or random interventions, as well as interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment. The package accommodates survival outcomes as well as binary or continuous outcomes measured at the end of follow-up.

An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre- Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model-abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we will discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA-approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the predictive performance of a statistical model is commonly done using cross-validation. Although the leave-one-out method is frequently employed, its application is justified primarily for independent and identically distributed observations. However, this method tends to mimic interpolation rather than prediction when dealing with dependent observations. This paper proposes a modified cross-validation for dependent observations. This is achieved by excluding an automatically determined set of observations from the training set to mimic a more reasonable prediction scenario. Also, within the framework of latent Gaussian models, we illustrate a method to adjust the joint posterior for this modified cross-validation to avoid model refitting. This new approach is accessible in the R-INLA package (www.r-inla.org).},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-\$t\$ prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a minimally invasive, image-guided approach to access lung lesions for biopsy or localization for treatment. However, no studies have reported prospective 24-month follow-up from a large, multinational, generalizable cohort. This study evaluated ENB safety, diagnostic yield, and usage patterns in an unrestricted, real-world observational design.
Methods
The NAVIGATE single-arm, pragmatic cohort study (NCT02410837) enrolled subjects at 37 academic and community sites in seven countries with prospective 24-month follow-up. Subjects underwent ENB using the superDimension navigation system versions 6.3 to 7.1. The prespecified primary end point was procedure-related pneumothorax requiring intervention or hospitalization.
Results
A total of 1388 subjects were enrolled for lung lesion biopsy (1329; 95.7\%), fiducial marker placement (272; 19.6\%), dye marking (23; 1.7\%), or lymph node biopsy (36; 2.6\%). Concurrent endobronchial ultrasound-guided staging occurred in 456 subjects. General anesthesia (78.2\% overall, 56.6\% Europe, 81.4\% United States), radial endobronchial ultrasound (50.6\%, 4.0\%, 57.4\%), fluoroscopy (85.0\%, 41.7\%, 91.0\%), and rapid on-site evaluation use (61.7\%, 17.3\%, 68.5\%) differed between regions. Pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 4.7\% and 2.7\% of subjects, respectively (3.2\% [primary end point] and 1.7\% requiring intervention or hospitalization). Respiratory failure occurred in 0.6\%. The diagnostic yield was 67.8\% (range: 61.9\%â70.7\%; 55.2\% Europe, 69.8\% United States). Sensitivity for malignancy was 62.6\%. Lung cancer clinical stage was I to II in 64.7\% (55.3\% Europe, 65.8\% United States).
Conclusions
Despite a heterogeneous cohort and regional differences in procedural techniques, ENB demonstrates low complications and a 67.8\% diagnostic yield while allowing biopsy, staging, fiducial placement, and dye marking in a single procedure.},

	abstract = {Background: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) procedures allow physicians to access peripheral lung lesions beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopy. However, published research is primarily limited to small, single-center studies using previous-generation ENB software. The impact of user experience, patient factors, and lesion/procedural characteristics remains largely unexplored in a large, multicenter study. Methods/Design: NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimensionâ¢ Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) is a prospective, multicenter, global, cohort study. The study aims to enroll up to 2,500 consecutive subjects presenting for evaluation of lung lesions utilizing the ENB procedure at up to 75 clinical sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Subjects will be assessed at baseline, at the time of procedure, and at 1, 12, and 24 months post-procedure. The pre-test probability of malignancy will be determined for peripheral lung nodules. Endpoints include procedure-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure, as well as quality of life, and subject satisfaction. Diagnostic yield and accuracy, repeat biopsy rate, tissue adequacy for genetic testing, and stage at diagnosis will be reported for biopsy procedures. Complementary technologies, such as fluoroscopy and endobronchial ultrasound, will be explored. Success rates of fiducial marker placement, dye marking, and lymph node biopsies will be captured when applicable. Subgroup analyses based on geography, demographics, investigator experience, and lesion and procedure characteristics are planned. Discussion: Study enrollment began in April 2015. As of February 19, 2016, 500 subjects had been enrolled at 23 clinical sites with enrollment ongoing. NAVIGATE will be the largest prospective, multicenter clinical study on ENB procedures to date and will provide real-world experience data on the utility of the ENB procedure in a broad range of clinical scenarios.

	abstract = {Researchers are increasingly using complex population-based sample surveys to estimate the effects of treatments, exposures and interventions. In such analyses, statistical methods are essential to minimize the effect of confounding due to measured covariates, as treated subjects frequently differ from control subjects. Methods based on the propensity score are increasingly popular. Minimal research has been conducted on how to implement propensity score matching when using data from complex sample surveys. We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine two critical issues when implementing propensity score matching with such data. First, we examined how the propensity score model should be formulated. We considered three different formulations depending on whether or not a weighted regression model was used to estimate the propensity score and whether or not the survey weights were included in the propensity score model as an additional covariate. Second, we examined whether matched control subjects should retain their natural survey weight or whether they should inherit the survey weight of the treated subject to which they were matched. Our results were inconclusive with respect to which method of estimating the propensity score model was preferable. In general, greater balance in measured baseline covariates and decreased bias was observed when natural retained weights were used compared to when inherited weights were used. We also demonstrated that bootstrap-based methods performed well for estimating the variance of treatment effects when outcomes are binary. We illustrated the application of our methods by using the Canadian Community Health Survey to estimate the effect of educational attainment on lifetime prevalence of mood or anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {Objective:Â 
          The aim of this study was to analyze overall survival (OS) of robotic-assisted lobectomy (RL), video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS), and open lobectomy (OL) performed by experienced thoracic surgeons across multiple institutions.
          Summary Background Data:Â 
          Surgeons have increasingly adopted RL for resection of early-stage lung cancer. Comparative survival data following these approaches is largely from single-institution case series or administrative data sets.
          Methods:Â 
          Retrospective data was collected from 21 institutions from 2013 to 2019. Consecutive cases performed for clinical stage IAâIIIA lung cancer were included. Induction therapy patients were excluded. The propensity-score method of inverse-probability of treatment weighting was used to balance baseline characteristics. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate association among OS and relevant risk factors.
          Results:Â 
          A total of 2789 RL, 2661 VATS, and 1196 OL cases were included. The unadjusted 5-year OS rate was highest for OL (84\%) followed by RL (81\%) and VATS (74\%); P=0.008. Similar trends were also observed after inverse-probability of treatment weighting adjustment (RL 81\%; VATS 73\%, OL 85\%, P=0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that OL and RL were associated with significantly higher OS compared with VATS (OL vs. VATS: hazard ratio=0.64, P{\textless}0.001 and RL vs. VATS: hazard ratio=0.79; P=0.007).
          Conclusions:Â 
          Our finding from this large multicenter study suggests that patients undergoing RL and OL have statistically similar OS, while the VATS group was associated with shorter OS. Further studies with longer follow-up are necessary to help evaluate these observations.},

	abstract = {Recurrent event data are common in clinical studies when participants are followed longitudinally, and are often subject to a terminal event. With the increasing popularity of large pragmatic trials with a heterogeneous source population, participants are often nested in clinics and can be either susceptible or structurally unsusceptible to the recurrent process. These complications require new modeling strategies to accommodate potential zero-event inflation as well as hierarchical data structures in both the terminal and non-terminal event processes. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian semi-parametric model to jointly characterize the zero-inflated recurrent event process and the terminal event process. We use a point mass mixture of non-homogeneous Poisson processes to describe the recurrent intensity and introduce shared random effects from different sources to bridge the non-terminal and terminal event processes. To achieve robustness, we consider nonparametric Dirichlet processes to model the residual of the accelerated failure time model for the survival process as well as the cluster-specific frailty distribution, and develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model compared with competing models via simulations and apply our method to a pragmatic cluster randomized trial for fall injury prevention among the elderly.},

Using examples in which novel trial designs have been successfully applied, they also illustrate the use of the tools involved, such as Bayesian methodologies, and discuss the advantages and challenges for their more widespread implementation. Declining pharmaceutical industry productivity is well recognized by drug developers, regulatory authorities and patient groups. A key part of the problem is that clinical studies are increasingly expensive, driven by the rising costs of conducting Phase II and III trials. It is therefore crucial to ensure that these phases of drug development are conducted more efficiently and cost-effectively, and that attrition rates are reduced. In this article, we argue that moving from the traditional clinical development approach based on sequential, distinct phases towards a more integrated view that uses adaptive design tools to increase flexibility and maximize the use of accumulated knowledge could have an important role in achieving these goals. Applications and examples of the use of these tools â such as Bayesian methodologies â in early- and late-stage drug development are discussed, as well as the advantages, challenges and barriers to their more widespread implementation.},

We provide an introduction to Bayesian inference for causal effects for practicing statisticians who have some familiarity with Bayesian models and would like an overview of what it can add to causal estimation in practical settings. In the paper, we demonstrate how priors can induce shrinkage and sparsity in parametric models and be used to perform probabilistic sensitivity analyses around causal assumptions. We provide an overview of nonparametric Bayesian estimation and survey their applications in the causal inference literature. Inference in the point-treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered. For the latter, we explore both static and dynamic treatment regimes. Throughout, we illustrate implementation using off-the-shelf open source software. We hope to leave the reader with implementation-level knowledge of Bayesian causal inference using both parametric and nonparametric models.

Competing risks in survival data concern a situation where there is more than one cause of failure, but only the occurrence of the first one is observable. In this paper, we considered Bayesian subdistribution hazard regression models with spatial random effects for the clustered HIV/AIDS data. An intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) distribution was employed to model the areal spatial random effects.

	abstract = {In the USA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services use 30-day readmission, following hospitalization, as a proxy outcome to monitor quality of care. These efforts generally focus on treatable health conditions, such as pneumonia and heart failure. Expanding quality-of-care systems to monitor conditions for which treatment options are limited or non-existent, such as pancreatic cancer, is challenging because of the non-trivial force of mortality; 30-day mortality for pancreatic cancer is approximately 30\%. In the statistical literature, data that arise when the observation of the time to some non-terminal event is subject to some terminal event are referred to as âsemicompeting risks dataâ. Given such data, scientific interest may lie in at least one of three areas: estimation or inference for regression parameters, characterization of dependence between the two events and prediction given a covariate profile. Existing statistical methods focus almost exclusively on the first of these; methods are sparse or non-existent, however, when interest lies with understanding dependence and performing prediction. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric regression framework for analysing semicompeting risks data that permits the simultaneous investigation of all three of the aforementioned scientific goals. Characterization of the induced posterior and posterior predictive distributions is achieved via an efficient MetropolisâHastingsâGreen algorithm, which has been implemented in an R package. The framework proposed is applied to data on 16051 individuals who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2005 and 2008, obtained from Medicare part A. We found that increased risk for readmission is associated with a high comorbidity index, a long hospital stay at initial hospitalization, non-white race, being male and discharge to home care.},

Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least three main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these three points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of âwhen to worryâ for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when âproblemsâ in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.},

Increasingly, extensions to standard joint modelling approaches are being proposed to handle complex data structures commonly encountered in applied research. In this paper, we propose a joint model for hierarchical longitudinal and time-to-event data. Our motivating application explores the association between tumor burden and progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. We define tumor burden as a function of the sizes of target lesions clustered within a patient. Since a patient may have more than one lesion, and each lesion is tracked over time, the data have a three-level hierarchical structure: repeated measurements taken at time points (level 1) clustered within lesions (level 2) within patients (level 3). We jointly model the lesion-specific longitudinal trajectories and patient-specific risk of death or disease progression by specifying novel association structures that combine information across lower level clusters (e.g. lesions) into patient-level summaries (e.g. tumor burden). We provide user-friendly software for fitting the model under a Bayesian framework. Lastly, we discuss alternative situations in which additional clustering factor(s) occur at a level higher in the hierarchy than the patient-level, since this has implications for the model formulation.},

	abstract = {Survival data is encountered in a range of disciplines, most notably health and medical research. Although Bayesian approaches to the analysis of survival data can provide a number of benefits, they are less widely used than classical (e.g. likelihood-based) approaches. This may be in part due to a relative absence of user-friendly implementations of Bayesian survival models. In this article we describe how the rstanarm R package can be used to fit a wide range of Bayesian survival models. The rstanarm package facilitates Bayesian regression modelling by providing a user-friendly interface (users specify their model using customary R formula syntax and data frames) and using the Stan software (a C++ library for Bayesian inference) for the back-end estimation. The suite of models that can be estimated using rstanarm is broad and includes generalised linear models (GLMs), generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), generalised additive models (GAMs) and more. In this article we focus only on the survival modelling functionality. This includes standard parametric (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz) and flexible parametric (spline-based) hazard models, as well as standard parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models. All types of censoring (left, right, interval) are allowed, as is delayed entry (left truncation), time-varying covariates, time-varying effects, and frailty effects. We demonstrate the functionality through worked examples. We anticipate these implementations will increase the uptake of Bayesian survival analysis in applied research.},

Since back transitions among the transient states are possible, Markov chains are often applied to this type of panel data.

However, existing control charts produce delay and false alarms when applying to semi-competing risk (SCR) data, which widely exist in biomedical and clinical fields. Some studies have suggested that SCR data are important for investigating the healthcare quality of hospitals, but there are seldom targeted control charts for monitoring the medical quality implied by them. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a risk-adjusted cumulative sum control chart based on illness-death semi-Markov model, named SCR-CUSUM, to monitor the deterioration of hospitalsâ medical quality by detecting the shifts of non-terminal and terminal events simultaneously. The chart statistic of SCR-CUSUM shows good interpretability. By replacing the preset log-likelihood ratio with the generalized likelihood ratio, SCR-CUSUM become more sensitive and general. Meanwhile, we provide the theoretical control limit and verify its feasibility. Both of the results of simulation and case study prove that SCR-CUSUM works better than the comparison methods when applying to SCR data. In addition, we also analyze the causes of false and delay alarms for existing control charts using simulation data.},

We also extend the framework to allow time-dependent effects. We then use an efficient and generalisable simulation method to calculate transition probabilities from any fitted multistate model, and show how it facilitates the simple calculation of clinically useful measures, such as expected length of stay in each state, and differences and ratios of proportion within each state as a function of time, for specific covariate patterns.

The aim of this paper is to present the R package SMM, devoted to the simulation and estimation of discretetime multi-state semi-Markov and Markov models. For the semi-Markov case we have considered: parametric and non-parametric estimation; with and without censoring at the beginning and/or at the end of sample paths; one or several independent sample paths. Several discrete-time distributions are considered for the parametric estimation of sojourn time distributions of semi-Markov chains: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Binomial Negative.},

	abstract = {Semi-Markov models are widely used for survival analysis and reliability analysis. In general, there are two competing parameterizations and each entails its own interpretation and inference properties. On the one hand, a semi-Markov process can be defined based on the distribution of sojourn times, often via hazard rates, together with transition probabilities of an embedded Markov chain. On the other hand, intensity transition functions may be used, often referred to as the hazard rates of the semi-Markov process. We summarize and contrast these two parameterizations both from a probabilistic and an inference perspective, and we highlight relationships between the two approaches. In general, the intensity transition based approach allows the likelihood to be split into likelihoods of two-state models having fewer parameters, allowing efficient computation and usage of many survival analysis tools. Nevertheless, in certain cases the sojourn time based approach is natural and has been exploited extensively in applications. In contrasting the two approaches and contemporary relevant R packages used for inference, we use two real datasets highlighting the probabilistic and inference properties of each approach.

	abstract = {Background
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that contributes substantially to perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Existing approaches to modeling and prediction of preeclampsia typically focus either on predicting preeclampsia risk alone, or on the timing of delivery following a diagnosis of preeclampsia. As such, they are misaligned with typical healthcare interactions during which the 2 events are generally considered simultaneously.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the âsemicompeting risksâ framework as an innovative approach for jointly modeling the risk and timing of preeclampsia and the timing of delivery simultaneously. Through this approach, one can obtain, at any point during the pregnancy, clinically relevant summaries of an individualâs predicted outcome trajectories in 4 risk categories: not developing preeclampsia and not having delivered, not developing preeclampsia but having delivered because of other causes, developing preeclampsia but not having delivered, and developing preeclampsia and having delivered.
Study Design
To illustrate the semicompeting risks methodology, we presented an example analysis of a pregnancy cohort from the electronic health record of an urban, academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts (n=9161 pregnancies). We fit an illnessâdeath model with proportional-hazards regression specifications describing 3 hazards for timings of preeclampsia, delivery in the absence of preeclampsia, and delivery following preeclampsia diagnosis.
Results
The results indicated nuanced relationships between a variety of risk factors and the timings of preeclampsia diagnosis and delivery, including maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, cigarette use, and proteinuria at 20 weeksâ gestation. Sample predictions for a diverse set of individuals highlighted differences in projected outcome trajectories with regard to preeclampsia risk and timing, and timing of delivery either before or after preeclampsia diagnosis.
Conclusion
The semicompeting risks framework enables characterization of the joint risk and timing of preeclampsia and delivery, providing enhanced, meaningful information regarding clinical decision-making throughout the pregnancy.},

The scarcity of knowledge about the probability of an elderly person needing help with activities of daily living has hindered the development of insurance solutions that complement existing social systems. In this paper, we consider two models: a frailty level model that studies the evolution of a dependent person through mild, moderate and severe dependency states to death and a type of care model that distinguishes between care received at home and care received in an institution. We develop and interpret the expressions for the state- and time-dependent transition probabilities in a semi-Markov framework. Then, we empirically assess these probabilities using a novel longitudinal dataset covering all LTC needs in Switzerland over a 20-year period. As a key result, we are the first to derive dependence probability tables by acuity level, gender and age for the Swiss population. We find that the transition probabilities differ significantly by gender, age and time spent in the frailty level and type of care states.},

	abstract = {The ECOG Scale of Performance Status (PS) is widely used to quantify the functional status of cancer patients, and is an important factor determining prognosis in a number of malignant conditions. The PS describes the status of symptoms and functions with respect to ambulatory status and need for care. PS 0 means normal activity, PS 1 means some symptoms, but still near fully ambulatory, PS 2 means less than 50\%, and PS 3 means more than 50\% of daytime in bed, while PS 4 means completely bedridden. An inter-observer variability study of PS assessment has been carried out to evaluate the non-chance agreement among three oncologists rating 100 consecutive cancer patients. Total unanimity was observed in 40 cases, unanimity between two observers in 53 cases, and total disagreement in seven cases. Kappa statistics reveal the ability of the observers compared to change alone and were used to evaluate non-chance agreement. Overall Kappa was 0.44, (95\% confidence limits 0.38-0.51). The Kappa for PS 0 was 0.55 (0.44-0.67), while those for PS 1, 2, 3 and four were 0.48 (0.37-0.60), 0.31 (0.19-0.42), 0.43 (0.32-0.55), and 0.33 (0.33-0.45), respectively. If one observer allocated patients to PS 0-2, then another randomly selected observed placed the patients in the same category with a probability of 0.92. For patients with PS 3-4 the probability that the same category would be chosen was 0.82. Overall, the non-chance agreement between observers was only moderate, when all ECOG Performance Status groups were considered. However, agreement with regard to allocation of patients to PS 0-2 versus 3-4 was high. This is of interest because this cut-off is often used in clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists are increasingly encountering complex longitudinal data, in which exposures and their confounders vary during follow-up. When a prior exposure aï¬ects the confounders of the subsequent exposures, estimating the eï¬ects of the time-varying exposures requires special statistical techniques, possibly with structural (ie, counterfactual) models for targeted eï¬ects, even if all confounders are accurately measured. Among the methods used to estimate such eï¬ects, which can be cast as a marginal structural model in a straightforward way, one popular approach is inverse probability weighting. Despite the seemingly intuitive theory and easy-to-implement software, misunderstandings (or âpitfallsâ) remain. For example, one may mistakenly equate marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting, failing to distinguish a marginal structural model encoding the causal parameters of interest from a nuisance model for exposure probability, and thereby failing to separate the problems of variable selection and model speciï¬cation for these distinct models. Assuming the causal parameters of interest are identiï¬ed given the study design and measurements, we provide a step-by-step illustration of generalized computation of standardization (called the gformula) and inverse probability weighting, as well as the speciï¬cation of marginal structural models, particularly for time-varying exposures. We use a novel hypothetical example, which allows us access to typically hidden potential outcomes. This illustration provides steppingstones (or âtipsâ) to understand more concretely the estimation of the eï¬ects of complex time-varying exposures.},

To do causal inference in survival analysis, one needs to address right-censoring, and often, special techniques are required for that purpose. We will show how censoring can be dealt with âonce and for allâ by means of so-called pseudo-observations when doing causal inference in survival analysis. The pseudo-observations can be used as a replacement of the outcomes without censoring when applying âstandardâ causal inference methods, such as (1) or (2) earlier. We study this idea for estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on the survival probability, the restricted mean lifetime, and the cumulative incidence in a competing risks situation. The methods will be illustrated in a small simulation study and via a study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received either myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation. We will estimate the average causal effect of the conditioning regime on outcomes such as the 3-year overall survival probability and the 3-year risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

The alternative Bayesian paradigm has been greatly enhanced by advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware. Compared to its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and for studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation, and analysis, and Web-based applications, which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More such trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate its real benefit in action.},

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that palliative care (PC) can improve quality of life and survival for outpatients with advanced cancer, but there are limited population-based data on the value of inpatient PC. We assessed PC as a component of high-value care among a nationally representative sample of inpatients with metastatic cancer and identified hospitalization characteristics significantly associated with high costs.
Methods
Hospitalizations of patients 18 years and older with a primary diagnosis of metastatic cancer from the National Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2019 were analyzed. We used multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression to assess medical services, patient demographics, and hospital characteristics associated with higher charges billed to insurance and hospital costs. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to determine cost savings associated with provision of PC.
Results
Among 397,691 hospitalizations from 2010 to 2019, the median charge per admission increased by 24.9\%, from \$44,904 in US dollars (USD) to \$56,098 USD, whereas the median hospital cost remained stable at \$14,300 USD. Receipt of inpatient PC was associated with significantly lower charges (odds ratio [OR], 0.62 [95\% CI, 0.61 to 0.64]; P {\textless} .001) and costs (OR, 0.59 [95\% CI, 0.58 to 0.61]; P {\textless} .001). Factors associated with high charges were receipt of invasive medical ventilation (P {\textless} .001) or systemic therapy (P {\textless} .001), Hispanic patients (P {\textless} .001), young age (18-49 years, P {\textless} .001), and for-profit hospitals (P {\textless} .001). PC provision was associated with a \$1,310 USD (â13.6\%, P {\textless} .001) reduction in costs per hospitalization compared with no PC, independent of the receipt of invasive care and age.
Conclusion
Inpatient PC is associated with reduced hospital costs for patients with metastatic cancer, irrespective of age and receipt of aggressive interventions. Integration of inpatient PC may de-escalate costs incurred through low-value inpatient interventions.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association that unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates and t-values, as well as âextreme scenariosâ. Finally, we describe problems with a common âbenchmarkingâ practice and introduce a novel procedure to bound the strength of confounders formally on the basis of a comparison with observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

In this paper, we explicitly define the causal question that is asked by these studies and discuss the problems associated with it. We argue that observational studies of obesity and mortality violate the condition of consistency of counterfactual (potential) outcomes, a necessary condition for meaningful causal inference, because (1) they do not explicitly specify the interventions on body mass index (BMI) that are being compared and (2) different methods to modify BMI may lead to different counterfactual mortality outcomes, even if they lead to the same BMI value in a given person. Besides precluding the estimation of unambiguous causal effects, this violation of consistency affects the ability to address two additional conditions that are also necessary for causal inference: exchangeability and positivity. We conclude that consistency violations not only preclude the estimation of well-defined causal effects but also compromise our ability to estimate ill-defined causal effects.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is assessed by self-administered questionnaires throughout the care process. Classically, two longitudinal statistical approaches were mainly used to study HRQoL: linear mixed models (LMM) or time-to-event models for time to deterioration/time until definitive deterioration (TTD/TUDD). Recently, an alternative strategy based on generalized linear mixed models for categorical data has also been proposed: the longitudinal partial credit model (LPCM). The objective of this article is to evaluate these methods and to propose recommendations to standardize longitudinal analysis of HRQoL data in cancer clinical trials. Methods: The three methods are first described and compared through statistical, methodological, and practical arguments, then applied on real HRQoL data from clinical cancer trials or published prospective databases. In total, seven French studies from a collaborating group were selected with longitudinal collection of QLQ-C30. Longitudinal analyses were performed with the three approaches using SAS, Stata and R software. Results: We observed concordant results between LMM and LPCM. However, discordant results were observed when we considered the TTD/TUDD approach compared to the two previous methods. According to methodological and practical arguments discussed, the approaches seem to provide additional information and complementary interpretations. LMM and LPCM are the most powerful methods on simulated data, while the TTD/TUDD approach gives more clinically understandable results. Finally, for single-item scales, LPCM is more appropriate. Conclusion: These results pledge for the recommendation to use of both the LMM and TTD/TUDD longitudinal methods, except for single-item scales, establishing them as the consensual methods for publications reporting HRQoL.},

	abstract = {Randomized clinical trials are the primary tool for evaluating new medical interventions. Randomization provides for a fair comparison between treatment and control groups, balancing out, on average, distributions of known and unknown factors among the participants. Unfortunately, these studies often lack a substantial percentage of data. This missing data reduces the benefit provided by the randomization and introduces potential biases in the comparison of the treatment groups. Missing data can arise for a variety of reasons, including the inability or unwillingness of participants to meet appointments for evaluation. And in some studies, some or all of data collection ceases when participants discontinue study treatment. Existing guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials, and the analysis of the resulting data, provide only limited advice on how to handle missing data. Thus, approaches to the analysis of data with an appreciable amount of missing values tend to be ad hoc and variable. The Prevention and Treatment of Missing Data in Clinical Trials concludes that a more principled approach to design and analysis in the presence of missing data is both needed and possible. Such an approach needs to focus on two critical elements: (1) careful design and conduct to limit the amount and impact of missing data and (2) analysis that makes full use of information on all randomized participants and is based on careful attention to the assumptions about the nature of the missing data underlying estimates of treatment effects. In addition to the highest priority recommendations, the book offers more detailed recommendations on the conduct of clinical trials and techniques for analysis of trial data.},

The purpose of conducting a pilot study is to examine the feasibility of an approach that is intended to be used in a larger scale study. The roles and limitations of pilot studies are described here using a clinical trial as an example. A pilot study can be used to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, new methods, and implementation of the novel intervention.A pilot study is not a hypothesis testing study. Safety, efficacy and effectiveness are not evaluated in a pilot. Contrary to tradition, a pilot study does not provide a meaningful effect size estimate for planning subsequent studies due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples. Feasibility results do not necessarily generalize beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pilot design.A pilot study is a requisite initial step in exploring a novel intervention or an innovative application of an intervention. Pilot results can inform feasibility and identify modifications needed in the design of a larger, ensuing hypothesis testing study. Investigators should be forthright in stating these objectives of a pilot study. Grant reviewers and other stakeholders should expect no more. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a by-product we obtain fast access to the baseline hazards (compared to survival::basehaz()) and predictions of survival probabilities, their confidence intervals and confidence bands. Confidence intervals and confidence bands are based on point-wise asymptotic expansions of the corresponding statistical functionals.

	abstract = {The FACT-L (version 3) is a 44-item self-report instrument which measures multidimensional quality of life. Available in eight languages, it is currently being used in several Phase II and III lung cancer clinical trials. Reliability and validity of the 33-item version 2 of the FACT-General (FACT-G) have previously been published. This paper reports further validation data on the FACT-G with a subsample of lung cancer patients from the original publication and, more importantly, presents data on the Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS). The nine LCS questions were administered along with the FACT-G to 116 patients with lung cancer. Internal consistency (coefficient alpha) was improved from 0.53 to 0.68 by dropping two questions which were uncorrelated with the others. A subset of 41 patients was tested again at 2 months to evaluate sensitivity to change in performance status rating (PSR) and to obtain estimates of a clinically meaningful change score for the FACT-G and the 7-item LCS. Using a linear test for trend, sensitivity to change in performance status rating (PSR) was obtained with the Total score (P = 0.03), the Physical Well Being (PWB) subscale (P = 0.02), the Functional Well Being (FWB) subscale (P = 0.05), and the LCS (P = 0.03). A 21-item Trial Outcome Index (TOI), combining scores on PWB, FWB and LCS, was highly reliable (coefficient a = 0.89) and sensitive to change in PSR F(1,38) = 4.84 (P = 0.01). This TOI is probably the most relevant and precise indicator of patient-reported quality of life available for lung cancer patients who complete the FACT-L while participating in an oncology clinical trial. The FACT-L may also be of benefit in evaluating quality of life in patients with lung diseases other than cancer. Â© 1995.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT (O6-methylguanine- DNA methyltransferase) DNA-repair gene by promoter methylation compromises DNA repair and has been associated with longer survival in patients with glioblastoma who receive alkylating agents. METHODS: We tested the relationship between MGMT silencing in the tumor and the survival of patients who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjuvant treatment with temozolomide. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter was determined by methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction analysis. RESULTS: The MGMT promoter was methylated in 45 percent of 206 assessable cases. Irrespective of treatment, MGMT promoter methylation was an independent favorable prognostic factor (P{\textless}0.001 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.61). Among patients whose tumor contained a methylated MGMT promoter, a survival benefit was observed in patients treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy; their median survival was 21.7 months (95 percent confidence interval, 17.4 to 30.4), as compared with 15.3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 13.0 to 20.9) among those who were assigned to only radiotherapy (P=0.007 by the log-rank test). In the absence of methylation of the MGMT promoter, there was a smaller and statistically insignificant difference in survival between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with glioblastoma containing a methylated MGMT promoter benefited from temozolomide, whereas those who did not have a methylated MGMT promoter did not have such a benefit.

The Declaration of Helsinki is a respected institution and one of the most influential documents in research ethics,1w1-w7 having withstood five revisions and two clarifications since its conception in 1964. Its guardian, the World Medical Association, recently invited submissions for further revision.2 The history of the declaration has been well documented.3 4 5 The Nuremberg Code (1947) was one of the first statements of the ethical principles involved in human experimentation.w8 However, because of its association with Nazi war crimes it had relatively little effect on practice.w9 The Declaration of Helsinki dealt with clinical research more directly, but was portrayed as a weakening of the stringent protections of Nuremberg. Nevertheless, for a quarter of a century only minor changes were made and it became engrained in the international culture of research ethics. In 1996, the declaration added a reference to placebos in response to concerns about trials in perinatal HIV transmission in developing countries . Critics pointed out that continuing to use placebos when efficacy had been demonstrated implied a different ethical standard for developing countries than for developed ones. Having entered into the specifics of trial design the declaration was drawn into a debate on whether ethical principles are â¦},

	abstract = {Background: International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials was developed as a consensus guidance document to encourage worldwide harmonization of the principles of statistical methodology in clinical trials. Addendum E9 (R1) clarified and extended ICH E9 with a focus on estimands and sensitivity analyses. Since the release of E9 (R1), clinical trial protocols have included estimands, but there is variation in how they are presented. Statistical analysis plans (SAPs) are increasingly becoming publicly available (e.g. posting on ClinicalTrials.gov) and present an opportunity to link estimands with planned analyses to present the alignment of trial objectives, design, conduct, and analysis. Methods: A table format was used to create a template for inclusion in SAPs that satisfies ICH E9 (R1) guidance to align statistical analysis to the estimand. The template provides a consistent structure for presentation of estimands and the associated analysis, and is applicable to a wide range of trial designs. We illustrate use of the template with a hypothetical clinical trial in HIV-1. Results: The estimand-to-analysis table template starts with the study objective describing the clinical question of interest as written in the trial protocol. The remainder of the table describes each attribute of the estimand (treatment, target population, variable, intercurrent events, and population-level summary) in the left column (ESTIMAND), while the right column describes how each attribute will be handled using the data collected in the clinical trial (ANALYSIS). The template was applied to a hypothetical, early-phase single-arm trial, modeled after a pediatric trial in HIV, where the objective was to determine the safety of a new antiretroviral drug as part of a combination antiretroviral treatment regimen in the pediatric population. Three intercurrent events were illustrated in the table: death, premature treatment discontinuation before 24 weeks, and pregnancy. An estimand-to-analysis table from a grant application that addresses the primary objective of a placebo-controlled randomized trial is also presented to demonstrate an alternative usage. Conclusion: We found the template to be useful in study design, providing a snapshot of the objective, target population, potential intercurrent events, analysis plan, and considerations for missing data in one place and facilitating discussion among stakeholders. The proposed standardized presentation of estimand attributes and analysis considerations in SAPs will provide guidance to SAP authors and consistency across studies to facilitate reviews.},

	volume = {37},
	doi = {10.3171/2014.9.FOCUS14502},
	abstract = {Object. The objective of this study was to report the authors' experience with the long-term administration of temozolomide (TMZ; {\textgreater} 6 cycles, up to 101) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to analyze its feasibility and safety as well as its impact on survival. The authors also compared data obtained from the group of patients undergoing long-term TMZ treatment with data from patients treated with a standard TMZ protocol. Methods. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 37 patients who underwent operations for glioblastoma between 2004 and 2012. Volumetric analysis of postoperative Gd-enhanced MR images, obtained within 48 hours, confirmed tumor gross-total resection (GTR) in all but 2 patients. All patients received the first cycle of TMZ at a dosage of 150 mg/m2 starting on the second or third postsurgical day. Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy according to the Stupp protocol. With regard to adjuvant TMZ therapy, the 19 patients in Group A, aged 30-72 years (mean 56.1 years), received 150 mg/m2 for 5 days every 28 days for more than 6 cycles (range 7-101 cycles). The 18 patients in Group B, aged 46-82 years (mean 64.8 years), received the same dose, but for no more than 6 cycles. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status was analyzed for both groups and correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The impact of age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and Ki 67 staining were also considered. Results. All patients but 1 in Group A survived at least 18 months (range 18-101 months), and patients in Group B survived no more than 17 months (range 2-17 months). The long-term survivors (Group A), defined as patients who survived at least 12 months after diagnosis, were 51.3\% of the total (19/37). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that patients treated with more than 6 TMZ cycles had OS and PFS that was significantly longer than patients receiving standard treatment (median OS 28 months vs 8 months, respectively; p = 0.0001; median PFS 20 months vs 4 months, respectively; p = 0.0002). By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, MGMT methylation status and number of TMZ cycles appeared to be survival prognostic factors in patients with glioblastoma. After controlling for MGMT status, highly significant differences related to OS and PFS between patients with standard and long-term TMZ treatment were still detected. Furthermore, in Group A and B, the statistical correlation of MGMT status to the number of TMZ cycles showed a significant difference only in Group A patients, suggesting that MGMT promoter methylation was predictive of response for long-term TMZ treatment. Prolonged therapy did not confer hematological toxicity or opportunistic infections in either patient group. Conclusions. This study describes the longest experience so far reported with TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas, with as many as 101 cycles, who were treated using GTR. Statistically significant data confirm that median survival correlates with MGMT promoter methylation status as well as with the number of TMZ cycles administered. Long-term TMZ therapy appears feasible and safe.},

	abstract = {Background: Standard treatment for glioblastoma is radiation with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for 6 cycles, although the optimal number of cycles of adjuvant temozolomide has long been a subject of debate. We performed a phase II randomized trial investigating whether extending adjuvant temozolomide for more than 6 cycles improved outcome. Methods: Glioblastoma patients treated at 20 Spanish hospitals who had not progressed after 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were centrally randomized to stop (control arm) or continue (experimental arm) temozolomide up to a total of 12 cycles at the same doses they were receiving in cycle 6. Patients were stratified by MGMT methylation and measurable disease. The primary endpoint was differences in 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were PFS, overall survival (OS), and safety (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02209948). Results: From August 2014 to November 2018, 166 patients were screened, 7 of whom were ineligible. Seventy-nine patients were included in the stop arm and 80 in the experimental arm. All patients were included in the analyses of outcomes and of safety. There were no differences in 6-month PFS (control 55.7\%; experimental 61.3\%), PFS, or OS between arms. MGMT methylation and absence of measurable disease were independent factors of better outcome. Patients in the experimental arm had more lymphopenia (P {\textless} 0.001), thrombocytopenia (P {\textless} 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Continuing temozolomide after 6 adjuvant cycles is associated with greater toxicity but confers no additional benefit in 6-month PFS. Key Points: 1. Extending adjuvant temozolomide to 12 cycles did not improve 6-month PFS. 2. Extending adjuvant temozolomide did not improve PFS or OS in any patient subset. 3. Extending adjuvant temozolomide was linked to increased toxicities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, but whether the addition of ezetimibe, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events further is not known. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (â¥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years. RESULTS The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (P{\textless}0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7\% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7\% in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95\% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS When added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit. (Funded by Merck; IMPROVE-IT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00202878.).},

Background: Patients (pts) receiving cancer treatment frequently experience burdensome symptoms that compromise outcomes and necessitate acute care. Prior clinical trials have demonstrated that electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO)-based symptom management programs improve outcomes in controlled settings. Deploying these programs in routine care settings remains challenging. With funding from the Cancer Moonshot IMPACT Consortium, we created eSyM â an ePRO-based, EHR-integrated symptom management program â to facilitate the widespread adoption of active symptom management efforts. Methods: eSyM was deployed across six health systems from September 2019-August 2022 via a modified stepped-wedge cluster randomized pragmatic trial. Pts starting chemotherapy (CHEM) or undergoing surgery (SURG) for a suspected or confirmed thoracic, gastrointestinal, or gynecologic cancer were prompted to complete symptom questionnaires regularly; those reporting symptoms were offered additional supports. To assess eSyM efficacy, we studied pts who were eligible to use the program â comparing those who completed at least one symptom questionnaire to those who did not. Outcomes included emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient encounters (INPT) at 30 and 90-days. Odds ratios with 95\% CIs were derived after adjusting to account for the propensity to report ePROs as a function of age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment, marital status, poverty, rurality, insurance, comorbidity, cancer, treatment goal, institution, and calendar time. Results: Among eSyM-eligible pts, 51\% (N = 10,454/20,471) completed at least one symptom questionnaire (median 4 reports/patient) â 47\% (3815/8187) for CHEM and 54\% (6639/12,293) for SURG. Comparing symptom reporters to non-reporters, the proportion of CHEM+SURG pts experiencing an ED event was 5.3\% vs. 7.1\% at 30 days and 10.0\% vs. 12.9\% at 90 days; and the proportion experiencing an INPT event was 6.7\% vs. 11.3\% at 30 days and 14.0\% vs. 19.5\% at 90 days (p{\textless} 0.001 for all). Adjusted ORs appear in the. Conclusions: After accounting for propensity to report symptoms, completing at least one symptom questionnaire was associated with lower odds of experiencing an ED or INPT encounter among CHEM and SURG pts across six diverse health systems. eSyM engagement reduced acute care utilization. This EHR-integrated symptom management solution is broadly available to health systems that use Epic. Clinical trial information: NCT03850912.

	abstract = {Objectives
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are essential when evaluating many new treatments in health care; yet, current measures have been limited by a lack of precision, standardization, and comparability of scores across studies and diseases. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) provides item banks that offer the potential for efficient (minimizes item number without compromising reliability), flexible (enables optional use of interchangeable items), and precise (has minimal error in estimate) measurement of commonly studied PROs. We report results from the first large-scale testing of PROMIS items.
Study Design and Setting
Fourteen item pools were tested in the U.S. general population and clinical groups using an online panel and clinic recruitment. A scale-setting subsample was created reflecting demographics proportional to the 2000 U.S. census.
Results
Using item-response theory (graded response model), 11 item banks were calibrated on a sample of 21,133, measuring components of self-reported physical, mental, and social health, along with a 10-item Global Health Scale. Short forms from each bank were developed and compared with the overall bank and with other well-validated and widely accepted (âlegacyâ) measures. All item banks demonstrated good reliability across most of the score distributions. Construct validity was supported by moderate to strong correlations with legacy measures.
Conclusion
PROMIS item banks and their short forms provide evidence that they are reliable and precise measures of generic symptoms and functional reports comparable to legacy instruments. Further testing will continue to validate and test PROMIS items and banks in diverse clinical populations.},

G-formula is typically implemented using Monte-Carlo simulation, with non-parametric bootstrapping used for inference. In longitudinal data settings missing data are a common issue, which are often handled using multiple imputation, but it is unclear how G-formula and multiple imputation should be combined. We show how G-formula can be implemented using Bayesian multiple imputation methods for synthetic data, and that by doing so, we can impute missing data and simulate the counterfactuals of interest within a single coherent approach. We describe how this can be achieved using standard multiple imputation software and explore its performance using a simulation study and an application from cystic fibrosis.},

            Background: We have previously reported on the successful implementation of an electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO)-based symptom monitoring tool in a community oncology practice. Basch etÂ al reported that use of such a tool in the academic trial setting reduced ER visits and hospitalizations. We have examined the impact of the tool on ER and inpatient utilization in this real world patient population. Methods: Highlands Oncology Group (HOG) is a 21 physician oncology group located in Northwest Arkansas. Beginning in June 2020, HOG offered patients receiving parenteral cancer therapy enrollment onto Expain, an EMR-integrated ePRO system which enables remote symptom monitoring during therapy. EMR data were linked with the Arkansas State Health Alliance for Records Exchange (SHARE), the stateâs Health Information Exchange (HIE), to obtain ER visits/hospitalization data. All patients at HOG treated between September 30, 2020 and November 30, 2021 were included in this analysis. Clinical and demographic characteristics were compared in patients who enrolled on Expain versus those who did not, and corresponding p-values were calculated using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests. Crude rates for ER visits / hospitalizations were calculated as the total number of events per total person-time. Results: There were 855 patients enrolled on the ePRO system. Concurrently, in the same practice, 1773 patients were treated but not enrolled. Reasons for non-enrollment included patientâs choice to not participate and patient not yet offered enrollment due to rolling enrollment. The non-ePRO cohort was slightly older (66.7 vs 63.3 yrs, p {\textless}.001), more commonly male (47.3\% vs 39.3\%, p {\textless}.001) and less likely to be White (85.3\% vs 89.4\%, p = 0.003). The cohorts were comparable with respect to cancer site distribution and included a diverse and representative distribution of common malignancies receiving systemic therapy in a community practice. The proportion of patients with metastatic disease was comparable (ePRO 52.9\% vs non-ePRO 51.6\%, p = 0.55). Health resource utilization rates were lower for patients in the ePRO cohort: ER visits: 1.72 vs 2.34 per 100 patient-months, rate ratio and 95\% CI = 0.74 (0.60, 0.92), p-value = 0.005; hospitalizations: 4.76 vs 5.41 per 100 patient-months, rate ratio and 95\% CI = 0.87 (0.77, 0.99), p-value = 0.04. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the substantial benefits of using an ePRO tool in reducing health care resource utilization, and extend the initial findings of previous publications in the academic, clinical trial setting to the real world setting. This observational data is subject to confounding factors and we are evaluating the robustness using various methods to address non-comparability of the cohorts. We are further examining the benefits in specific patient subsets and attempting to correlate these benefits with improved survival.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether electronic symptom monitoring during cancer treatment confers benefits on quality-of-life outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Report of secondary outcomes from the PRO-TECT (Alliance AFT-39) cluster randomized trial in 52 US community oncology practices randomized to electronic symptom monitoring with PRO surveys or usual care. Between October 2017 and March 2020, 1191 adults being treated for metastatic cancer were enrolled, with last follow-up on May 17, 2021. INTERVENTIONS In the PRO group, participants (n = 593) were asked to complete weekly surveys via an internet-based or automated telephone system for up to 1 year. Severe or worsening symptoms triggered care team alerts. The control group (n = 598) received usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 3 prespecified secondary outcomes were physical function, symptom control, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at 3 months, measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30; range, 0-100 points; minimum clinically important difference [MCID], 2-7 for physical function; no MCID defined for symptom control or HRQOL). Results on the primary outcome, overall survival, are not yet available.
RESULTS Among 52 practices, 1191 patients were included (mean age, 62.2 years; 694 [58.3\%] women); 1066 (89.5\%) completed 3-month follow-up. Compared with usual care, mean changes on the QLQ-C30 from baseline to 3 months were significantly improved in the PRO group for physical function (PRO, from 74.27 to 75.81 points; control, from 73.54 to 72.61 points; mean difference, 2.47 [95\% CI, 0.41-4.53]; P = .02), symptom control (PRO, from 77.67 to 80.03 points; control, from 76.75 to 76.55 points; mean difference, 2.56 [95\% CI, 0.95-4.17]; P = .002), and HRQOL (PRO, from 78.11 to 80.03 points; control, from 77.00 to 76.50 points; mean difference, 2.43 [95\% CI, 0.90-3.96]; P = .002). Patients in the PRO group had significantly greater odds of experiencing clinically meaningful benefits vs usual care for physical function (7.7\% more with improvements of Õ5 points and 6.1\% fewer with worsening of Õ5 points; odds ratio [OR], 1.35 [95\% CI, 1.08-1.70]; P = .009), symptom control (8.6\% and 7.5\%, respectively; OR, 1.50 [95\% CI, 1.15-1.95]; P = .003), and HRQOL (8.5\% and 4.9\%, respectively; OR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.10-1.81]; P = .006).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this report of secondary outcomes from a randomized clinical trial of adults receiving cancer treatment, use of weekly electronic PRO surveys to monitor symptoms, compared with usual care, resulted in statistically significant improvements in physical function, symptom control, and HRQOL at 3 months, with mean improvements of approximately 2.5 points on a 0- to 100-point scale. These findings should be interpreted provisionally pending results of the primary outcome of overall survival.},

In observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal-effect estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple simulations to provide an accessible explanation for why change scores do not estimate causal effects in observational data.Data were simulated to match three general scenarios in which the outcome variable at baseline was a (i) âcompeting exposureâ (i.e. a cause of the outcome that is neither caused by nor causes the exposure), (ii) confounder or (iii) mediator for the total causal effect of the exposure variable at baseline on the outcome variable at follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses and the appropriate estimator(s) for the total and/or direct causal effect(s).Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal-effect estimates unless the baseline outcome variable is a âcompeting exposureâ for the effect of the exposure on the outcome at follow-up. Where the baseline outcome is a confounder or mediator, change-score analyses evaluate obscure estimands, which may diverge substantially in magnitude and direction from the total and direct causal effects.Future observational studies that seek causal-effect estimates should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical strategies.},

They commonly arise when a variable has been functionally created from one or more parent variables, as with derived variables, and in compositional data, where the âwholeâ variable is determined from its âparts.â This article introduces how deterministic variables may be depicted within directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to help with identifying and interpreting causal effects involving derived variables and/or compositional data. We propose a 2-step approach in which all variables are initially considered, and a choice is made as to whether to focus on the deterministic variable or its determining parents. Depicting deterministic variables within DAGs brings several benefits. It is easier to identify and avoid misinterpreting tautological associations, that is, self-fulfilling associations between deterministic variables and their parents, or between sibling variables with shared parents. In compositional data, it is easier to understand the consequences of conditioning on the âwholeâ variable and to correctly identify total and relative causal effects. For derived variables, it encourages greater consideration of the target estimand and greater scrutiny of the consistency and exchangeability assumptions. DAGs with deterministic variables are a useful aid for planning and interpreting analyses involving derived variables and/or compositional data.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference and the use of posterior or posterior predictive probabilities for decision making have become increasingly popular in clinical trials. The current practice in Bayesian clinical trials relies on a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist approach where the design and decision criteria are assessed with respect to frequentist operating characteristics such as power and type I error rate conditioning on a given set of parameters. These operating characteristics are commonly obtained via simulation studies. The utility of Bayesian measures, such as ``assurance", that incorporate uncertainty about model parameters in estimating the probabilities of various decisions in trials has been demonstrated recently. However, the computational burden remains an obstacle toward wider use of such criteria. In this article, we propose methodology which utilizes large sample theory of the posterior distribution to define parametric models for the sampling distribution of the posterior summaries used for decision making. The parameters of these models are estimated using a small number of simulation scenarios, thereby refining these models to capture the sampling distribution for small to moderate sample size. The proposed approach toward the assessment of conditional and marginal operating characteristics and sample size determination can be considered as simulation-assisted rather than simulation-based. It enables formal incorporation of uncertainty about the trial assumptions via a design prior and significantly reduces the computational burden for the design of Bayesian trials in general.},

	abstract = {Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is an increasingly popular framework for the estimation of causal effects. It requires modeling both the exposure and outcome but is doubly robust in the sense that it is valid if at least one of these models is correctly specified. In addition, TMLE allows for flexible modeling of both the exposure and outcome with machine learning methods. This provides better control for measured confounders since the model specification automatically adapts to the data, instead of needing to be specified by the analyst a priori. Despite these methodological advantages, TMLE remains less popular than alternatives in part because of its less accessible theory and implementation. While some tutorials have been proposed, none address the case of a time-to-event outcome. This tutorial provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the implementation of TMLE for estimating the effect of a point binary or multilevel exposure on a time-to-event outcome, modeled as counterfactual survival curves and causal hazard ratios. The tutorial also provides guidelines on how best to use TMLE in practice, including aspects related to study design, choice of covariates, controlling biases and use of machine learning. R-code is provided to illustrate each step using simulated data ( https://github.com/detal9/SurvTMLE). To facilitate implementation, a general R function implementing TMLE with options to use machine learning is also provided. The method is illustrated in a real-data analysis concerning the effectiveness of statins for the prevention of a first cardiovascular disease among older adults in QuÃ©bec, Canada, between 2013 and 2018.},

Approaches based on modelling the treatment assignment mechanism, along with their doubly robust extensions, have been difficult to motivate using formal likelihood-based or Bayesian arguments, as the treatment assignment model plays no part in inferences concerning the expected outcomes. On the other hand, forcing dependency between the outcome and treatment assignment models by allowing the former to be misspecified results in loss of the balancing property of the propensity scores and the loss of any double robustness. In this paper, we explain in the framework of misspecified models why doubly robust inferences cannot arise from purely likelihood-based arguments. As an alternative to Bayesian propensity score analysis, we propose a Bayesian posterior predictive method for constructing doubly robust estimation procedures by incorporating the inverse treatment assignment probabilities as importance sampling weights in Monte Carlo integration.},

	abstract = {Objective: To demonstrate how the optimal decision and level of uncertainty associated with that decision, can be presented when assessing the cost-effectiveness of multiple options. To explore and explain potentially counterintuitive results that can arise when analyzing multiple options. Methods: A template was created, based on the assumption of multivariate normality, in order to replicate a previous analysis that compared the cost-effectiveness of multiple options. We used this template to explain some of the different shapes that the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF), and expected value of perfection information (EVPI) may take, with changing correlation structure and variance between the multiple options. Results: We show that it is possible for 1) an option that is subject to extended dominance to have the highest probability of being cost-effective for some values of the cost-effectiveness threshold; 2) the most cost-effective (optimal) option to never have the highest probability of being cost-effective; and 3) the EVPI to increase when the probability of making the wrong decision decreases. Changing the correlation structure between multiple options did not change the presentation of results on the cost-effectiveness plane. Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness plane has limited use in representing the uncertainty surrounding multiple options as it cannot represent correlation between the options. CEACs can represent decision uncertainty, but should not be used to determine the optimal decision. Instead, the CEAF shows the decision uncertainty surrounding the optimal choice and this can be augmented by the EVPI to show the potential gains to further research.},

	abstract = {Semi-competing risks refer to the phenomenon where a primary event (such as mortality) can ``censor'' an intermediate event (such as relapse of a disease), but not vice versa. Under the multi-state model, the primary event consists of two specific types: the direct outcome event and an indirect outcome event developed from intermediate events. Within this framework, we show that the total treatment effect on the cumulative incidence of the primary event can be decomposed into three separable pathway effects, capturing treatment effects on population-level transition rates between states. We next propose two estimators for the counterfactual cumulative incidences of the primary event under hypothetical treatment components. One estimator is given by the generalized Nelson--Aalen estimator with inverse probability weighting under covariates isolation, and the other is given based on the efficient influence function. The asymptotic normality of these estimators is established. The first estimator only involves a propensity score model and avoid modeling the cause-specific hazards. The second estimator has robustness against the misspecification of submodels. As an illustration of its potential usefulness, the proposed method is applied to compare effects of different allogeneic stem cell transplantation types on overall survival after transplantation.},

            Colorectal cancer is a prevalent malignancy with global significance. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the influence of stage and tumor site on survival outcomes in 284 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2017. Patients were categorized into four groups based on tumor site (colon and rectum) and disease stage (early stage and advanced stage). Demographic characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival outcomes were recorded. Bayesian survival modeling was performed using semi-competing risks illness-death models with an accelerated failure time (AFT) approach, utilizing R 4.1 software. Results demonstrated significantly higher time ratios for disease recurrence (TRâ=â1.712, 95\% CI 1.489â2.197), mortality without recurrence (TRâ=â1.933, 1.480â2.510), and mortality after recurrence (TRâ=â1.847, 1.147â2.178) in early-stage colon cancer compared to early-stage rectal cancer. Furthermore, patients with advanced-stage rectal cancer exhibited shorter survival times for disease recurrence than patients with early-stage colon cancer. The interaction effect between the disease site and cancer stage was not significant. These findings, derived from the optimal Bayesian log-normal model for terminal and non-terminal events, highlight the importance of early detection and effective management strategies for colon cancer. Early-stage colon cancer demonstrated improved survival rates for disease recurrence, mortality without recurrence, and mortality after recurrence compared to other stages. Early intervention and comprehensive care are crucial to enhance prognosis and minimize adverse events in colon cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Multi-state models provide a unified framework for the description of the evolution of discrete phenomena in continuous time. One particular example is Markov processes which can be characterised by a set of time-constant transition intensities between the states. In this paper, we will extend such parametric approaches to semiparametric models with flexible transition intensities based on Bayesian versions of penalised splines. The transition intensities will be modelled as smooth functions of time and can further be related to parametric as well as nonparametric covariate effects. Covariates with time-varying effects and frailty terms can be included in addition. Inference will be conducted either fully Bayesian (using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques) or empirically Bayesian (based on a mixed model representation). A counting process representation of semiparametric multi-state models provides the likelihood formula and also forms the basis for model validation via martingale residual processes. As an application, we will consider human sleep data with a discrete set of sleep states such as REM and non-REM phases. In this case, simple parametric approaches are inappropriate since the dynamics underlying human sleep are strongly varying throughout the night and individual-specific variation has to be accounted for using covariate information and frailty terms.},

Eligible patients from 15 urban or rural clinics within a large community oncology network in Tennessee had advanced lung or noncolorectal gastrointestinal cancer and were identified by an automated EHR algorithm adapted from national guidelines. Data were analyzed between November 1, 2023, and March 4, 2024.At sites randomized to control, clinicians received weekly reports detailing PC referral rates compared with peer clinicians (peer comparison) and referred patients to PC at their discretion. At sites randomized to intervention, clinicians also received default PC orders using the EHR. Clinicians who opted out of PC consultation were asked to provide justification (accountable justification). If clinicians did not opt out, a study coordinator contacted patients to introduce and schedule PC visits using a standardized, predefined script.The primary outcome was a completed PC consultation within 12 weeks of enrollment. Exploratory outcomes included quality of life, feeling heard and understood, and intensive end-of-life care. Outcomes were analyzed using clustered generalized linear and logistic regression models.The trial enrolled 562 patients (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [10.1] years; 288 male [51.2\%]), of whom 433 (77.0\%) had lung cancer.

There were no differences in quality of life, feeling heard and understood, or late hospice referral.In this randomized clinical trial of algorithm-based EHR defaults, the intervention increased PC consultations and decreased end-of-life systemic therapy.

            Causal inference with observational longitudinal data and time-varying exposures is often complicated by time-dependent confounding and attrition. The G-computation formula is one approach for estimating a causal effect in this setting. The parametric modelling approach typically used in practice relies on strong modelling assumptions for valid inference and moreover depends on an assumption of missing at random, which is not appropriate when the missingness is missing not at random (MNAR) or due to death. In this work we develop a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric G-computation approach for assessing the causal effect on the subpopulation that would survive irrespective of exposure, in a setting with MNAR dropout. The approach is to specify models for the observed data using Bayesian additive regression trees, and then, use assumptions with embedded sensitivity parameters to identify and estimate the causal effect. The proposed approach is motivated by a longitudinal cohort study on cognition, health and ageing and we apply our approach to study the effect of becoming a widow on memory. We also compare our approach to several standard methods.},

The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nursesâ Health Study. Over the period 1982â2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50\%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.46â2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nursesâ Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale application of the parametric g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

	abstract = {Observational studies are often conducted to estimate causal effects of treatments or exposures on event-time outcomes. Since treatments are not randomized in observational studies, techniques from causal inference are required to adjust for confounding. Bayesian approaches to causal estimates are desirable because they provide 1) prior smoothing provides useful regularization of causal effect estimates, 2) flexible models that are robust to misspecification, 3) full inference (i.e. both point and uncertainty estimates) for causal estimands. However, Bayesian causal inference is difficult to implement manually and there is a lack of user-friendly software, presenting a significant barrier to wide-spread use. We address this gap by developing causalBETA (Bayesian Event Time Analysis) - an open-source R package for estimating causal effects on event-time outcomes using Bayesian semiparametric models. The package provides a familiar front-end to users, with syntax identical to existing survival analysis R packages such as survival. At the same time, it back-ends to Stan - a popular platform for Bayesian modeling and high performance statistical computing - for efficient posterior computation. To improve user experience, the package is built using customized S3 class objects and methods to facilitate visualizations and summaries of results using familiar generic functions like plot() and summary(). In this paper, we provide the methodological details of the package, a demonstration using publicly-available data, and computational guidance.},

          The Women's Health Initiative randomized trial found greater coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in women assigned to estrogen/progestin therapy than in those assigned to placebo. Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users.
          Methods:Â 
          Using data from the observational Nursesâ Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of âtrials,â in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy.
          Results:Â 
          The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92â2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78â1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61â1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84â1.48) in the others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97â2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66â1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19â1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78â1.84) in others (P value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nursesâ Health Study estimates.
          Conclusions:Â 
          Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nursesâ Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

              Germline genetic testing is recommended by practice guidelines for patients diagnosed with cancer to enable genetically targeted treatment and identify relatives who may benefit from personalized cancer screening and prevention.


              Objective
              To describe the prevalence of germline genetic testing among patients diagnosed with cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2019.


              Design, Setting, and Participants
              Observational study including patients aged 20 years or older who had been diagnosed with any type of cancer between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019, that was reported to statewide Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in California and Georgia. These patients were linked to genetic testing results from 4 laboratories that performed most germline testing for California and Georgia.


              Main Outcomes and Measures
              The primary outcome was germline genetic testing within 2 years of a cancer diagnosis. Testing trends were analyzed with logistic regression modeling. The results of sequencing each gene, including variants associated with increased cancer risk (pathogenic results) and variants whose cancer risk association was unknown (uncertain results), were evaluated. The genes were categorized according to their primary cancer association, including breast or ovarian, gastrointestinal, and other, and whether practice guidelines recommended germline testing.


              Results

                Among 1â¯369â¯602 patients diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2019 in California and Georgia, 93â¯052 (6.8\%) underwent germline testing through March 31, 2021. The proportion of patients tested varied by cancer type: male breast (50\%), ovarian (38.6\%), female breast (26\%), multiple (7.5\%), endometrial (6.4\%), pancreatic (5.6\%), colorectal (5.6\%), prostate (1.1\%), and lung (0.3\%). In a logistic regression model, compared with the 31\% (95\% CI, 30\%-31\%) of non-Hispanic White patients with male breast cancer, female breast cancer, or ovarian cancer who underwent testing, patients of other races and ethnicities underwent testing less often: 22\% (95\% CI, 21\%-22\%) of Asian patients, 25\% (95\% CI, 24\%-25\%) of Black patients, and 23\% (95\% CI, 23\%-23\%) of Hispanic patients (

                2
                test). Of all pathogenic results, 67.5\% to 94.9\% of variants were identified in genes for which practice guidelines recommend testing and 68.3\% to 83.8\% of variants were identified in genes associated with the diagnosed cancer type.



              Conclusions and Relevance
              Among patients diagnosed with cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2019, only 6.8\% underwent germline genetic testing. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, rates of testing were lower among Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients.},

              Background
              To investigate the prognostic relevance of the time to interval debulking surgery (TTS) and the time to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (TTC) after the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).


              Methods
              A retrospective real-word study included 658 patients with histologically confirmed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who received NACT at seven tertiary hospitals in China from June 2008 to June 2020. TTS was defined as the time interval from the completion of NACT to the time of interval debulking surgery (IDS). TTC was defined as the time interval from the completion of NACT to the initiation of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (PACT).


              Results

                The median TTS and TTC were 25 (IQR, 20â29) and 40 (IQR, 33â49) days, respectively. Patients with TTSâ{\textgreater}â25 days were older (55 vs. 53 years,

                P
                â=â0.002). Similar results were observed in patients with TTCâ{\textgreater}â40 days. In the multivariate analyses, TTS and TTC were not associated with PFS when stratified by median, quartile, or integrated as continuous variables (all

              Conclusion
              The delays of IDS and PACT after the completion of NACT have adverse impacts on OS but no impacts on PFS, which indicates that reducing delays of IDS and PACT might ameliorate the outcomes of ovarian cancer patients treated with NACT.},

We seek to steer practitioners away from a naive approach to Bayesian inference, namely estimating the posterior distribution in each completed dataset and averaging functionals of these distributions. We demonstrate that this approach results in unreliable inferences. A better approach is to mix draws from the posterior distributions from each completed dataset, and use the mixed draws to summarize the posterior distribution. Using simulations, we show that for this second approach to work well, the number of imputed datasets should be large. In particular, five to ten imputed datasetsâwhich is the standard recommendation for multiple imputationâis generally not enough to result in reliable Bayesian inferences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Â 
          Transversus abdominis plane blocks are increasingly used to achieve opioid-sparing analgesia after colorectal surgery. Traditionally, bupivacaine was the long-acting analgesic of choice, but the addition of dexamethasone and/or epinephrine to bupivacaine may extend block duration. Liposomal bupivacaine has also been suggested to achieve an extended analgesia duration of 72 hours but is significantly more expensive.
          OBJECTIVE:Â 
          The purpose of this study was to compare pain control between laparoscopic transversus abdominis plane blocks using liposomal bupivacaine versus bupivacaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone.
          DESIGN:Â 
          This was a parallel-group, single-institution, randomized clinical trial.
          SETTINGS:Â 
          The study was conducted at a single tertiary medical center.
          PATIENTS:Â 
          Consecutive patients between October 2018 to October 2019, ages 18 to 90 years, undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery with multimodal analgesia were included.
          INTERVENTIONS:Â 
          Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a laparoscopic transversus abdominis plane block with liposomal bupivacaine or bupivacaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone.
          MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Â 
          The primary outcome was total oral morphine equivalents administered in the first 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, time to ambulation and solid diet, hospital length of stay, and complications.
          RESULTS:Â 
          A total of 102 patients (50 men) with a median age of 42 years (interquartile range, 29â60 y) consented and were randomly assigned. The primary end point, total oral morphine equivalents administered in the first 48 hours, was not significantly different between the liposomal bupivacaine group (median = 69âmg) and the bupivacaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone group (median = 47âmg; difference in medians = 22âmg, (95\% CI, â17 to 49âmg); p = 0.60). There were no significant differences in pain scores, time to ambulation, time to diet tolerance, time to bowel movement, length of stay, overall complications, or readmission rate between groups. There were no treatment-related adverse outcomes.
          LIMITATIONS:Â 
          This study was not placebo controlled or blinded.
          CONCLUSIONS:Â 
          This first randomized trial comparing laparoscopic transversus abdominis plane block with liposomal bupivacaine or bupivacaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone showed that a liposomal bupivacaine block does not provide superior or extended analgesia in the era of standardized multimodal analgesia protocols.

          ESTUDIO PROSPECTIVO Y RANDOMIZADO DE BLOQUEO DEL PLANO MUSCULAR TRANSVERSO DEL ABDOMEN REALIZADO POR EL CIRUJANO CON BUPIVACAÃNA VERSUS BUPIVACAÃNA LIPOSOMAL: ESTUDIO TINGLEÂ 
          ANTECEDENTES:
          El bloqueo anestÃ©sico del plano muscular transverso del abdomen se utiliza cada vez mÃ¡s para lograr una analgesia con menos consumo de opioides despuÃ©s de cirugÃ­a colorrectal. Tradicionalmente, la BupivacaÃ­na era el analgÃ©sico de acciÃ³n prolongada de elecciÃ³n, pero al agregarse Dexametasona y/o Adrenalina a la BupivacaÃ­na se puede prolongar la duraciÃ³n del bloqueo. TambiÃ©n se ha propuesto que la BupivacaÃ­na liposomal logra una duraciÃ³n prolongada de la analgesia de 72 horas, pero es significativamente mÃ¡s cara.
          OBJETIVO:
          Comparar el control del dolor entre bloqueo laparoscÃ³pico del plano de los transversos del abdomen usando BupivacaÃ­na liposomal versus BupivacaÃ­na con Adrenalina y Dexametasona.
          DISEÃO:
          Estudio clÃ­nico prospectivo y randomizado de una sola instituciÃ³n en grupos paralelos.
          AJUSTE:
          Centro mÃ©dico terciario Ãºnico.
          PACIENTES:
          Todos aquellos pacientes entre 18 y 90 aÃ±os sometidos a cirugÃ­a colorrectal mÃ­nimamente invasiva con analgesia multimodal, entre octubre de 2018 a octubre de 2019 incluidos de manera consecutiva.
          INTERVENCIONES:
          Los pacientes fueron seleccionados aleatoriamente 1:1 para recibir un bloqueo laparoscÃ³pico del plano de los transversos del abdomen con BupivacaÃ­na liposomal o BupivacaÃ­na con Adrenalina y Dexametasona.
          PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:
          El resultado primario fue el total de equivalentes de morfina oral administradas en las primeras 48 horas despuÃ©s de la operaciÃ³n. Los resultados secundarios incluyeron puntuaciones de dolor, inicio de dieta sÃ³lida, tiempo de inicio a la deambulaciÃ³n, la estadÃ­a hospitalaria y las complicaciones.
          RESULTADOS:
          Un total de 102 pacientes (50 hombres) con una mediana de edad de 42 aÃ±os (IQR 29-60) fueron incluidos aleatoriamente. El criterio de valoraciÃ³n principal, equivalentes de morfina oral total administrada en las primeras 48 horas, no fue significativamente diferente entre el grupo de BupivacaÃ­na liposomal (mediana = 69âmg) y el grupo de BupivacaÃ­na con Adrenalina y Dexametasona (mediana = 47âmg; diferencia en medianas = 22âmg, IC del 95\% [-17] - 49âmg, p = 0,60). No hubo diferencias significativas en las puntuaciones de dolor, tiempo de inicio a la deambulaciÃ³n, el tiempo de tolerancia a la dieta sÃ³lida, el tiempo hasta el primer evacuado intestinal, la duraciÃ³n de la estadÃ­a hospitalaria, las complicaciones generales o la tasa de readmisiÃ³n entre los grupos. No hubo resultados adversos relacionados con el tratamiento.
          LIMITACIONES:
          Este estudio no fue controlado con placebo ni de manera cegada.
          CONCLUSIONES:
          Este primer estudio prospectivo y randomizado que comparÃ³ el bloqueo del plano de los mÃºsculos transversos del abdomen por vÃ­a laparoscÃ³pica, utilizando BupivacaÃ­na liposomal o BupivacaÃ­na con Adrenalina y Dexametasona, demostrÃ³ que el bloqueo de BupivacaÃ­na liposomal no proporciona ni mejor analgesia ni un efecto mas prolongado.

	abstract = {Causal inference for non-censored response variables, such as binary or quantitative outcomes, is often based on either (1) direct standardization (âG-formulaâ) or (2) inverse probability of treatment assignment weights (âpropensity scoreâ). To do causal inference in survival analysis, one needs to address right-censoring, and often, special techniques are required for that purpose. We will show how censoring can be dealt with âonce and for allâ by means of so-called pseudo-observations when doing causal inference in survival analysis. The pseudo-observations can be used as a replacement of the outcomes without censoring when applying âstandardâ causal inference methods, such as (1) or (2) earlier. We study this idea for estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on the survival probability, the restricted mean lifetime, and the cumulative incidence in a competing risks situation. The methods will be illustrated in a small simulation study and via a study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received either myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation. We will estimate the average causal effect of the conditioning regime on outcomes such as the 3-year overall survival probability and the 3-year risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

	abstract = {The restricted mean survival time (RMST) has become a popular measure to summarize event times in longitudinal studies. Defined as the area under the survival function up to a time horizon \${\textbackslash}tau\$ {\textgreater} 0, the RMST can be interpreted as the life expectancy within the time interval [0, \${\textbackslash}tau\$]. In addition to its straightforward interpretation, the RMST also allows for the definition of valid estimands for the causal analysis of treatment contrasts in medical studies. In this work, we introduce a non-parametric approach to model the RMST conditional on a set of baseline variables (including, e.g., treatment variables and confounders). Our method is based on a direct modeling strategy for the RMST, using leave-one-out jackknife pseudo-values within a random forest regression framework. In this way, it can be employed to obtain precise estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and confounder-adjusted treatment contrasts. Since our method (termed "pseudo-value random forest", PVRF) is model-free, RMST estimates are not affected by restrictive assumptions like the proportional hazards assumption. Particularly, PVRF offers a high flexibility in detecting relevant covariate effects from higher-dimensional data, thereby expanding the range of existing pseudo-value modeling techniques for RMST estimation. We investigate the properties of our method using simulations and illustrate its use by an application to data from the SUCCESS-A breast cancer trial. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PVRF yields accurate estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and RMST-based treatment contrasts.},

This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The CausalImpact R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

In this groundbreaking text, two world-renowned experts present statistical methods for studying such questions. This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including, matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables. Many detailed applications are included, with special focus on practical aspects for the empirical researcher.},

Mediation analysis is a statistical approach to identify third variables, and to estimate and test third-variable effects that explain the exposure â outcome association. In this paper, we propose three methods for mediation analysis in Bayesian settings: (1) the function of coefficients method, (2) the product of partial differences method, and (3) the resampling method. The explicit benefit of the Bayesian mediation analysis is that the hierarchical relationships between the exposure variable and third variables, and between third variables and the outcome are naturally built into the Bayesian models. We performed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the choice of prior distributions in the three Bayesian inference methods. We found that the proposed methods are robust across a range of priors. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using real data from the MY-Health Study to explore racial/ethnic disparities in anxiety among cancer survivors.

	abstract = {Causal mediation analysis provides investigators insight into how a treatment or exposure can affect an outcome of interest through one or more mediators on causal pathway. When multiple mediators on the pathway are causally ordered, identification of mediation effects on certain causal pathways requires a sensitivity parameter to be specified. A mixed model-based approach was proposed in the Bayesian framework to connect potential outcomes at different treatment levels, and identify mediation effects independent of a sensitivity parameter, for the natural direct and indirect effects on all causal pathways. The proposed method is illustrated in a linear setting for mediators and outcome, with mediator-treatment interactions. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the prior choices in the Bayesian models. The proposed Bayesian method was applied to an adolescent dental health study, to see how social economic status can affect dental caries through a sequence of causally ordered mediators in dental visit and oral hygiene index.},

	abstract = {In the presence of unmeasured heterogeneity, the hazard ratio for exposure has a complex causal interpretation. To address this, accelerated failure time (AFT) models, which assess the effect on the survival time ratio scale, are often suggested as a better alternative. AFT models also allow for straightforward confounder adjustment. In this work, we formalize the causal interpretation of the acceleration factor in AFT models using structural causal models and data under independent censoring. We prove that the acceleration factor is a valid causal effect measure, even in the presence of frailty and treatment effect heterogeneity. Through simulations, we show that the acceleration factor better captures the causal effect than the hazard ratio when both AFT and proportional hazards models apply. Additionally, we extend the interpretation to systems with time-dependent acceleration factors, revealing the challenge of distinguishing between a time-varying homogeneous effect and unmeasured heterogeneity. While the causal interpretation of acceleration factors is promising, we caution practitioners about potential challenges in estimating these factors in the presence of effect heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Background The past decade has seen an explosion of research in causal mediation analysis. However, most analytic tools developed so far rely on frequentist methods which may not be robust in the case of small sample sizes. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach for causal mediation analysis based on Bayesian g-formula, which will overcome the limitations of the frequentist methods. Methods We created BayesGmed, an R-package for fitting Bayesian mediation models in R. The application of the methodology (and software tool) is demonstrated by a secondary analysis of data collected as part of the MUSICIAN study, a randomised controlled trial of remotely delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (tCBT) for people with chronic pain. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of tCBT would be mediated by improvements in active coping, passive coping, fear of movement and sleep problems. We then demonstrate the use of informative priors to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis around violations of causal identification assumptions. Result The analysis of MUSICIAN data shows that tCBT has better-improved patientsâ self-perceived change in health status compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The adjusted log-odds of tCBT compared to TAU range from 1.491 (95\% CI: 0.452â2.612) when adjusted for sleep problems to 2.264 (95\% CI: 1.063â3.610) when adjusted for fear of movement. Higher scores of fear of movement (log-odds, -0.141 [95\% CI: -0.245, -0.048]), passive coping (log-odds, -0.217 [95\% CI: -0.351, -0.104]), and sleep problem (log-odds, -0.179 [95\% CI: -0.291, -0.078]) leads to lower odds of a positive self-perceived change in health status. The result of BayesGmed, however, shows that none of the mediated effects are statistically significant. We compared BayesGmed with the mediation R- package, and the results were comparable. Finally, our sensitivity analysis using the BayesGmed tool shows that the direct and total effect of tCBT persists even for a large departure in the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Conclusion This paper comprehensively overviews causal mediation analysis and provides an open-source software package to fit Bayesian causal mediation models.},

A lot of the recent writing has focused on concerns of causal identification (under which conditions is it, in principle, possible to recover causal effects?); in this primer, we turn to causal estimation (how do researchers actually turn the data into an effect estimate?) and modern approaches to it that are commonly used in epidemiology. First, we explain how causal estimands can be defined rigorously with the help of the potential-outcomes framework, and we highlight four crucial assumptions necessary for causal inference to succeed (exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and noninterference). Next, we present three types of approaches to causal estimation and compare their strengths and weaknesses: propensity-score methods (in which the independent variable is modeled as a function of controls), g-computation methods (in which the dependent variable is modeled as a function of both controls and the independent variable), and doubly robust estimators (which combine models for both independent and dependent variables). A companion R Notebook is available at github.com/ArthurChatton/CausalCookbook. We hope that this nontechnical introduction not only helps psychologists and other social scientists expand their causal toolbox but also facilitates communication across disciplinary boundaries when it comes to causal inference, a research goal common to all fields of research.},

The frequentist inference procedure for RMST has been widely advocated for comparison of two survival curves, while research from the Bayesian perspective is rather limited. For the RMST of both right- and interval-censored data, we propose Bayesian nonparametric estimation and inference procedures. By assigning a mixture of Dirichlet processes (MDP) prior to the distribution function, we can estimate the posterior distribution of RMST. We also explore another Bayesian nonparametric approach using the Dirichlet process mixture model and make comparisons with the frequentist nonparametric method. Simulation studies demonstrate that the Bayesian nonparametric RMST under diffuse MDP priors leads to robust estimation and under informative priors it can incorporate prior knowledge into the nonparametric estimator. Analysis of real trial examples demonstrates the flexibility and interpretability of the Bayesian nonparametric RMST for both right- and interval-censored data.},

Additionally, We propose two methods: one using random effects to account for heterogeneity among clusters and another utilizing frailty. We developed custom Stan code for the exponential, Weibull, log-normal frailty, and log-logistic models, as they cannot be processed using the brm functions in R. We evaluate our proposed methods through computer simulations and analyze real data from the eight Empowered Action Group states in India to confirm consistent results across states after adjusting for cluster differences. In conclusion, we derived explicit RMST formulas for parametric models and their distributions, enabling the calculation of the mean, median, mode, and credible interval.

They also have potential for providing real-world effectiveness and safety evidence in pharmacoepidemiology. To effectively add to the toolkit of the field, however, designsâincluding both their benefits and drawbacksâmust be well understood. Quasi-experimental designs provide an opportunity to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated without requiring the measurement of all possible confounding factors, and to assess population-level effects. This requires, however, other key assumptions, including the parallel trends or stable weighting assumptions, a lack of other concurrent events that could alter time trends, and an absence of contamination between exposed and unexposed units. The targeted estimands are also highly specific to the settings of the study, and combining across units or time periods can be challenging. Case studies are presented for 3 vaccine evaluation studies, showcasing some of these challenges and opportunities in a specific field of pharmacoepidemiology.

	abstract = {Background: Gastroesophageal reï¬ux (GERD) is common among patients with obesity who undergo bariatric surgery. Although gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are the most common bariatric operations performed in the United States, their long-term comparative effectiveness on GERD medication use is unknown.
Objective: To compare the long-term effectiveness of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on use of antireï¬ux medication. Setting: National cohort undergoing inpatient bariatric surgery.
Methods: This is a retrospective study of Medicare beneï¬ciaries undergoing gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017. A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted to evaluate the differential change in antireï¬ux medication use between groups before and after surgery.
Results: A total of 16,640 patients underwent gastric bypass, and 26,724 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Before surgery, GERD medication use was higher among patients who underwent gastric bypass (62.4\%; 95\% conï¬dence interval [CI]: 62.0\%â63.7\%) compared with patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (60.1\%; 95\% CI: 59.3\%â60.9\%). Five years after surgery, GERD medication use was lower in patients who underwent gastric bypass (47.8\%; 95\% CI: 46.3\%â49.3\%) compared with patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy (53.7\%; 95\% CI: 50.5\%â56.9\%). The differential decrease from baseline GERD medication use was greater for patients who underwent gastric bypass at 2 years (â4.1 percentage points [pp]; 95\% CI: â1.7 to â6.5 pp), 3 years (â4.3 pp; 95\% CI: â1.6 to â7.0 pp), 4 years (â6.9 pp; 95\% CI: â4.1 to â9.6 pp), and 5 years (â8.3 pp; 95\% CI: â3.7 to 12.8 pp) after surgery.
Conclusion: Though use of antireï¬ux medication decreased following both procedures, gastric bypass was associated with a greater reduction in antireï¬ux medication use 5 years after surgery compared with sleeve gastrectomy. Understanding the long-term comparative effectiveness of these},

	abstract = {The R package BayesPPD (Bayesian Power Prior Design) supports Bayesian power and type I error calculation and model fitting after incorporating historical data with the power prior and the normalized power prior for generalized linear models (GLM). The package accommodates summary level data or subject level data with covariate information. It supports use of multiple historical datasets as well as design without historical data. Supported distributions for responses include normal, binary (Bernoulli/binomial), Poisson and exponential. The power parameter can be fixed or modeled as random using a normalized power prior for each of these distributions. In addition, the package supports the use of arbitrary sampling priors for computing Bayesian power and type I error rates. In addition to describing the statistical methodology and functions implemented in the package to enable sample size determination (SSD), we also demonstrate the use of BayesPPD in two comprehensive case studies.},

The Delphi survey was sent to statisticians in trial units who completed the survey of current practice (nâ=â46), CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) and SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guideline authors (nâ=â16), pharmaceutical industry statisticians (nâ=â3), journal editors (nâ=â9), and regulators (nâ=â2) (3 participants were included in 2 groups each), culminating in a consensus meeting attended by experts (Nâ=â12) with representatives from each group. The guidance subsequently underwent critical review by statisticians from the surveyed trial units and members of the expert panel of the consensus meeting (Nâ=â51), followed by piloting of the guidance document in the SAPs of 5 trials.No existing guidance was identified. The registered trials unit survey (46 responses) highlighted diversity in current practice and confirmed support for developing guidance. The Delphi survey (54 of 73, 74\% participants completing both rounds) reached consensus on 42\% (nâ=â46) of 110 items. The expert panel (Nâ=â12) agreed that 63 items should be included in the guidance, with an additional 17 items identified as important but may be referenced elsewhere. Following critical review and piloting, some overlapping items were combined, leaving 55 items.Recommendations are provided for a minimum set of items that should be addressed and included in SAPs for clinical trials. Trial registration, protocols, and statistical analysis plans are critically important in ensuring appropriate reporting of clinical trials.},

CONCLUSION: Two independent cohorts of patients with head and neck cancers were compared according to the presence of the professional navigator (Exposed cohort nÂ¼83) or not (Historical cohort nÂ¼75). The Exposed cohort showed a better proï¬le on several indicators of outcomes. The results clearly indicate an association between the presence of the professional navigator with continuity of care (higher satisfaction and shorter duration of hospitalization), and empowerment (fewer cancer-related problems, including body images concerns, and better emotional quality of life). IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses can not only play an important role in continuity of care but also in supportive care by helping patients to cope better with cancer treatments, recovery or cancer progression and death issues.},

This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

	abstract = {Following the seminal publications of Rubin about thirty years ago, statisticians have become increasingly aware of the inadequacy of âcomplete-caseâ analysis of datasets with missing observations. In medicine, for example, observations may be missing in a sporadic way for different covariates, and a complete-case analysis may omit as many as half of the available cases. Hotdeck imputation was implemented in Stata in 1999 by Mander and Clayton. However, this technique may perform poorly when many rows of data have at least one missing value. This article describes an implementation for Stata of the MICE method of multiple multivariate imputation described by van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook (1999). MICE stands for multivariate imputation by chained equations. The basic idea of data analysis with multiple imputation is to create a small number (e.g., 5â10) of copies of the data, each of which has the missing values suitably imputed, and analyze each complete dataset independently. Estimates of parameters of interest are averaged across the copies to give a single estimate. Standard errors are computed according to the âRubin rulesâ, devised to allow for the between- and within-imputation components of variation in the parameter estimates. This article describes five ado-files. mvis creates multiple multivariate imputations. uvis imputes missing values for a single variable as a function of several covariates, each with complete data. micombine fits a wide variety of regression models to a multiply imputed dataset, combining the estimates using Rubin's rules, and supports survival analysis models (stcox and streg), categorical data models, generalized linear models, and more. Finally, misplit and mijoin are utilities to intercon-vert datasets created by mvis and by the miset program from John Carlin and colleagues. The use of the routines is illustrated with an example of prognostic modeling in breast cancer.},

Previously used standards in survival analysis have been site- and/or study-speciï¬c. Here, multivariate methods have been used to deï¬ne the smallest possible number of general standard cancer patient populations which are simple to use and provide standardised survival values close to the raw ones for the largest possible number of cancer sites. The analysis was based on data for over 1.1 million cancer patients included in the EUROCARE-2 study. The proposed standard populations consist of three age distributions, appropriate for cancers with incidence patterns: (1) increasing with age â the vast majority of cancers; (2) broadly constant with age and (3) mainly aï¬ecting young adults. The three standard distributions are presented by both broad and ï¬ve-year age classes. The latter can be used to determine which of the three standards would be used for sites not included in the cluster analysis because their survival is generally calculated in unusual age groups. Overall, standard 1 is appropriate for over 91\% of cases, standard 2 for just over 7\%, and standard 3 for less than 2\%. The proposed standards were tested on European (EUROCARE-2 and EUROCARE-3) and US (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, SEER) relative survival data. There was very good correspondence between the raw (population weighted) and age-standardised survival ï¬gures.},

	abstract = {Background: The rising incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been largely attributed to the increasing use of imaging procedures.
Objective: Our aim was to examine stage-speciï¬c incidence, mortality, and survival trends of RCC in North America. Design, setting, and participants: We computed age-adjusted incidence, survival, and mortality rates using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database. Between 1988 and 2006, 43 807 patients with histologically conï¬rmed RCC were included.
Measurements: We calculated incidence, mortality, and 5-yr survival rates by year. Reported ï¬ndings were stratiï¬ed according to disease stage.
Results and limitations: Age-adjusted incidence rate of RCC rose from 7.6 per 100 000 person-years in 1988 to 11.7 in 2006 (estimated annual percentage change [EAPC]: +2.39\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Stage-speciï¬c age-adjusted incidence rates increased for localized stage: 3.8 in 1988 to 8.2 in 2006 (EAPC: +4.29\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and decreased during the same period for distant stage: 2.1 to 1.6 (EAPC: Ã0.57\%; p = 0.01). Stage-speciï¬c survival rates improved over time for localized stage but remained stable for regional and distant stages. Mortality rates varied signiï¬cantly over the study period among localized stage, 1.3 in 1988 to 2.4 in 2006 (EAPC: +3.16\%; p {\textless} 0.001), and distant stage, 1.8 in 1988 to 1.6 in 2006 (EAPC: Ã0.53\%; p = 0.045). Better detailed staging information represents a main limitation of the study.
Conclusions: The incidence rates of localized RCC increased rapidly, whereas those of distant RCC declined. Mortality rates signiï¬cantly increased for localized stage and decreased for distant stage. Innovation in diagnosis and management of RCC remains necessary.},

	abstract = {P -values and the p {\textless} 0.05 rule of thumb came into use before the computing revolution. Assuming the null hypothesis is true greatly simplified the model, often requiring only manual calculations. But the traditional straw-man null hypothesis testing approach to establishing statistical evidence about efficacy or safety of a drug has a number of deficiencies, many of them caused by the indirectness of the approach, including the use of probabilities of events that already occurred conditional on facts that are unknown. P -values and type I assertion probability Î± are often assumed to provide the error probabilities regulators need, but the chance that an approved drug is ineffective given the data is actually the direct Bayesian posterior probability that efficacy falls below an acceptable level. Furthermore, the rules of logic supporting proof by contradiction, based on certainties and not probabilities, donât apply to the uncertainties of traditional null hypothesis testing. Just as in medical diagnosis, forward probabilistic thinking leads to optimum decisions. The Bayesian approach involves direct estimation of time-forward probabilities of clinical interest and does not need to concern itself with long-run operating characteristics such as the number of false positives from a large set of imagined exact replications of exactly null clinical trials. Instead, Bayesian methods aim to maximize the probability of making the best decision about drug efficacy and safety for the single problem at hand. The Bayesian approach applies to complex study designs, incorporates applicable prior information, results in cleaner interpretations on a clinical as opposed to a randomness scale, and provides a fully self-contained model-based approach to inference needing no after-the-fact adjustments for context/multiplicities. In some ways frequentist hypothesis testing involves modeling noise while Bayesian inference involves modeling signal.},

	abstract = {It is a truth universally acknowledged that an observed association without known mechanism must be in want of a causal estimate. However, causal estimation from observational data often relies on the (untestable) assumption of `no unobserved confounding'. Violations of this assumption can induce bias in effect estimates. In principle, such bias could invalidate or reverse the conclusions of a study. However, in some cases, we might hope that the influence of unobserved confounders is weak relative to a `large' estimated effect, so the qualitative conclusions are robust to bias from unobserved confounding. The purpose of this paper is to develop {\textbackslash}emph\{Austen plots\}, a sensitivity analysis tool to aid such judgments by making it easier to reason about potential bias induced by unobserved confounding. We formalize confounding strength in terms of how strongly the confounder influences treatment assignment and outcome. For a target level of bias, an Austen plot shows the minimum values of treatment and outcome influence required to induce that level of bias. Domain experts can then make subjective judgments about whether such strong confounders are plausible. To aid this judgment, the Austen plot additionally displays the estimated influence strength of (groups of) the observed covariates. Austen plots generalize the classic sensitivity analysis approach of Imbens [Imb03]. Critically, Austen plots allow any approach for modeling the observed data and producing the initial estimate. We illustrate the tool by assessing biases for several real causal inference problems, using a variety of machine learning approaches for the initial data analysis.

Each requires the introduction of a set of covariates, which remains difficult to choose, especially regarding the different methods. We conduct a simulation study to compare the relative performance results obtained by using four different sets of covariates (those causing the outcome, those causing the treatment allocation, those causing both the outcome and the treatment allocation, and all the covariates) and four methods: g-computation, inverse probability of treatment weighting, full matching and targeted maximum likelihood estimator. Our simulations are in the context of a binary treatment, a binary outcome and baseline confounders. The simulations suggest that considering all the covariates causing the outcome led to the lowest bias and variance, particularly for g-computation. The consideration of all the covariates did not decrease the bias but significantly reduced the power. We apply these methods to two real-world examples that have clinical relevance, thereby illustrating the real-world importance of using these methods.

G-computation is an alternative because of its high statistical power. Machine learning is also increasingly used because of its possible robustness to model misspecification. In this paper, we aimed to propose an approach that combines machine learning and G-computation when both the outcome and the exposure status are binary and is able to deal with small samples. We evaluated the performances of several methods, including penalized logistic regressions, a neural network, a support vector machine, boosted classification and regression trees, and a super learner through simulations. We proposed six different scenarios characterised by various sample sizes, numbers of covariates and relationships between covariates, exposure statuses, and outcomes. We have also illustrated the application of these methods, in which they were used to estimate the efficacy of barbiturates prescribed during the first 24Â h of an episode of intracranial hypertension. In the context of GC, for estimating the individual outcome probabilities in two counterfactual worlds, we reported that the super learner tended to outperform the other approaches in terms of both bias and variance, especially for small sample sizes. The support vector machine performed well, but its mean bias was slightly higher than that of the super learner. In the investigated scenarios, G-computation associated with the super learner was a performant method for drawing causal inferences, even from small sample sizes.},

Despite recent advancements in causal subgroup analysis, research on time-to-event outcomes has been lacking. This article investigates the propensity score weighting method for causal subgroup survival analysis. We introduce two causal estimands, the subgroup marginal hazard ratio and subgroup restricted average causal effect, and provide corresponding propensity score weighting estimators. We analytically established that the bias of subgroup-restricted average causal effect is determined by subgroup covariate balance. Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of various combinations of propensity score models (logistic regression, random forests, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and generalized boosted models) and weighting schemes (inverse probability weighting, and overlap weighting) for estimating the causal estimands. We find that the logistic model with subgroup-covariate interactions selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator consistently outperforms other propensity score models. Also, overlap weighting generally outperforms inverse probability weighting in terms of balance, bias and variance, and the advantage is particularly pronounced in small subgroups and/or in the presence of poor overlap. We applied the methods to the observational Comparing Options for Management: PAtient-centered REsults for Uterine Fibroids study to evaluate the causal effects of myomectomy versus hysterectomy on the time to disease recurrence in a number of pre-specified subgroups of patients with uterine fibroids.},

	abstract = {We study time-dependent mediators in survival analysis using a treatment separation approach due to Didelez [2019] and based on earlier work by Robins and Richardson [2011]. This approach avoids nested counterfactuals and crossworld assumptions which are otherwise common in mediation analysis. The causal model of treatment, mediators, covariates, confounders and outcome is represented by causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, the DAGs tend to be very complex when we have measurements at a large number of time points. We therefore suggest using so-called rolled graphs in which a node represents an entire coordinate process instead of a single random variable, leading us to far simpler graphical representations. The rolled graphs are not necessarily acyclic; they can be analyzed by \${\textbackslash}delta\$-separation which is the appropriate graphical separation criterion in this class of graphs and analogous to \$d\$-separation. In particular, \${\textbackslash}delta\$-separation is a graphical tool for evaluating if the conditions of the mediation analysis are met or if unmeasured confounders influence the estimated effects. We also state a mediational g-formula. This is similar to the approach in Vansteelandt et al. [2019] although that paper has a different conceptual basis. Finally, we apply this framework to a statistical model based on a Cox model with an added treatment effect.survival analysis; mediation; causal inference; graphical models; local independence graphs},

A recently proposed alternative, inspired by the Survivor Average Causal Effect, is the causal HR, defined as the ratio between hazards across treatment groups among the study participants that would have survived regardless of their treatment assignment. We discuss the challenge in identifying the causal HR and present a sensitivity analysis identification approach in randomized controlled trials utilizing a working frailty model. We further extend our framework to adjust for potential confounders using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We present a Cox-based and a flexible non-parametric kernel-based estimation under right censoring. We study the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimation methods through simulations. We illustrate the utility of our framework using two real-data examples.},

	abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

Short- and long-term mortality was compared between DSWI patients and non-DSWI patients using propensity score inverse probability weighting adjustment based on patient characteristics and comorbidities. Median follow-up was 8.0âyears (range 0â18.9).Altogether, 1516 patients (1.3\%) developed DSWI, most commonly in patients undergoing combined CABG and valve surgery (2.1\%). DSWI patients were older and had more disease burden than non-DSWI patients. The unadjusted cumulative mortality was higher in the DSWI group compared with the non-DSWI group at 90âdays (7.9\% vs 3.0\%, Pâ\&lt;â0.001) and at 1 year (12.8\% vs 4.5\%, Pâ\&lt;â0.001). The adjusted absolute difference in risk of death was 2.3\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.8â3.9] at 90âdays and 4.7\% (95\% CI: 2.6â6.7) at 1 year.

Before being granted access to data or funding, researchers may need to prove that âthe statistical power of their analysis will be high.â Analyses expected to have low power, and hence result in imprecise estimates, will not be approved. This restrictive attitude towards observational analyses is misguided. A key misunderstanding is the belief that the goal of a causal analysis is to âdetectâ an effect. Causal effects are not binary signals that are either detected or undetected; causal effects are numerical quantities that need to be estimated. Because the goal is to quantify the effect as unbiasedly and precisely as possible, the solution to observational analyses with imprecise effect estimates is not avoiding observational analyses with imprecise estimates, but rather encouraging the conduct of many observational analyses. It is preferable to have multiple studies with imprecise estimates than having no study at all. After several studies become available, we will meta-analyze them and provide a more precise pooled effect estimate. Therefore, the justification to withhold an observational analysis of preexisting data cannot be that our estimates will be imprecise. Ethical arguments for power calculations before conducting a randomized trial which place individuals at risk are not transferable to observational analyses of existing databases. If a causal question is important, analyze your data, publish your estimates, encourage others to do the same, and then meta-analyze. The alternative is an unanswered question.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Â 
          Medicaid expansion impacted patients when assessed at a national level. However, of the 32 states that expanded Medicaid, only three were Southern states. Whether results apply to Southern states that share similar geopolitical perspectives remains elusive. We aimed to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment in 8 Southern states in the US.
          STUDY DESIGN:Â 
          We identified uninsured or Medicaid patients (age 40 to 64 years) diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 2011 to 2018 in Southern states from the North American Association of Central Cancer RegistriesâCancer in North America Research Dataset. Medicaid-expanded states ([MES], Louisiana, Kentucky, Arkansas) were compared with non-MES ([NMES], Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma) using multivariate logistic regression and differences-in-differences analyses during pre- and postexpansion periods; p {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
          RESULTS:Â 
          Among 21,974 patients, patients in MES had increased odds of Medicaid insurance by 43\% (odds ratio 1.43, p {\textless} 0.01) and decreased odds of distant-stage disease by 7\% (odds ratio 0.93, p = 0.03). After Medicaid expansion, Medicaid patients increased by 10.6\% in MES (Arkansas, Kentucky), in contrast to a 1.3\% decrease in NMES (differences-in-differences 11.9\%, p {\textless} 0. 0001, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, rural-urban status, and poverty status). MES (Arkansas, Kentucky) had 2.3\% fewer patients diagnosed with distant-stage disease compared with a 0.5\% increase in NMES (differences-in-differences 2.8\%, p = 0.01, after adjustment). Patients diagnosed in MES had higher odds of receiving treatment (odds ratio 2.27, p = 0.03).
          CONCLUSIONS:Â 
          Unlike NMES, MES experienced increased Medicaid insured, increased treatment, and decreased distant-stage disease at diagnosis. Medicaid expansion in the South leads to earlier and more comprehensive treatment of breast cancer.

	abstract = {Background: An evaluation of the effect of a healthcare intervention (or an exposure) must consider multiple possible outcomes, including the primary outcome of interest and other outcomes such as adverse events or mortality. The determination of the likelihood of benefit from an intervention, in the presence of other competing outcomes, is a competing risks problem. Although statistical methods exist for quantifying the probability of benefit from an intervention while accounting for competing events, these methods have not been widely adopted by clinical researchers. Objectives: (1) To demonstrate the importance of considering competing risks in the evaluation of treatment effectiveness, and (2) to review appropriate statistical methods, and recommend how they might be applied. Research Design and Methods: We reviewed 3 statistical approaches for analyzing the competing risks problem: (a) cause-specific hazard (CSH), (b) cumulative incidence function (CIF), and (c) event-free survival (EFS). We compare these methods using a simulation study and a reanalysis of a randomized clinical trial. Results: Simulation studies evaluating the statistical power to detect the effect of intervention under different scenarios showed that: (1) CSH approach is best for detecting the effect of an intervention if the intervention only affects either the primary outcome or the competing event; (2) EFS approach is best only when the intervention affects both primary and competing events in the same manner; and (3) CIF approach is best when the intervention affects both primary and competing events, but in opposite directions. Using data from a randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that a comprehensive approach using all 3 approaches provided useful insights on the},

The proportional hazards assumption can be tested by examining the residuals of the model. The rejection of the null hypothesis induces the use of time varying coefficient to describe the data.

	abstract = {Objectives: Studies of palliative care are often performed using single-arm preâpost study designs that lack causal inference. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel data analysis approach that incorporates risk factors from single-arm studies instead of using paired t-tests to assess intervention effects.
Methods: Physical, psychological and social evaluations of eligible cancer inpatients were conducted by a hospital-based palliative care team. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and after 7âdays of symptomatic treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL. Among 35 patients, 9 were discharged within 1âweek and 26 were included in analyses. Structural equation models with observed measurements were applied to estimate direct and indirect intervention effects and simultaneously consider risk factors.
Results: Parameters were estimated using full models that included associations among covariates and reduced models that excluded covariates with small effects. The total effect was calculated as the sum of intervention and covariate effects and was equal to the mean of the difference (0.513) between pre- and post-intervention quality of life (reduced model intervention effect, 14.749; 95\% confidence intervals, â4.407 and 33.905; pâ=â0.131; covariate effect, â14.236; 95\% confidence interval, â33.708 and 5.236; pâ=â0.152).

	abstract = {Objectives. To quantify selection bias because of observed and unobserved characteristics in a PC demonstration program.
Methods. Program administrative data and 100\% Medicare claims data in two states and a 20\% sample in eight states (2013e2017). The sample included 2983 Medicare fee-for-service beneï¬ciaries aged 65Ã¾ participating in the PC program and three matched cohorts: regional; two states; and eight states. Confounding because of observed factors was measured by comparing patient baseline characteristics. Confounding because of unobserved factors was measured by comparing days of follow-up and six-month and one-year mortality rates.
Results. After matching, evidence for observed confounding included differences in observable baseline characteristics, including race, morbidity, and utilization. Evidence for unobserved confounding included signiï¬cantly longer mean follow-up in the regional, two-state, and eight-state comparison cohorts, with 207 (P {\textless} 0.001), 192 (P {\textless} 0.001), and 187 (P {\textless} 0.001) days, respectively, compared with the 162 days for the PC cohort. The PC cohort had higher six-month and one-year mortality rates of 53.5\% and 64.5\% compared with 43.5\% and 48.0\% in the regional comparison, 53.4\% and 57.4\% in the two-state comparison, and 55.0\% and 59.0\% in the eight-state comparison.
Conclusion. This case study demonstrates that selection of comparison groups impacts the magnitude of measured and unmeasured confounding, which may change effect estimates. The substantial impact of confounding on effect estimates in this study raises concerns about the evaluation of novel serious illness care models in the absence of randomization. We present key lessons learned for improving future evaluations of PC using observational study designs. J Pain Symptom Manage 2021;61:1002e1011.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and aggressive liver cancer. As most patients are diagnosed during an incurable stage of the disease, they usually face great suffering during the end-of-life period. Palliative care can improve the patientâs quality of life and alleviate both physical and psychological symptoms. However, the discipline is underutilized due to a common misconception that it will accelerate the patientâs death. We emulated a hypothetical target trial to evaluate the causal effect of palliative care consultation on the survival time of patients diagnosed with HCC from retrospective observational data of a Thai tertiary care center. Although no clear survival benefit or harm was identified, palliative care consultation significantly reduced the use of unnecessary life-sustaining intervention, healthcare costs, and the risk of dying in the hospital among patients with HCC during their end-of-life period.

Abstract
Palliative care has the potential to improve the quality of life of patients with incurable diseases or cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A common misconception of palliative care with respect to the patientâs survival remains a significant barrier to the discipline. This study aimed to provide causal evidence for the effect of palliative care consultation on the survival time after diagnosis among HCC patients. An emulation of a target trial was conducted on a retrospective cohort of HCC patients from January 2017 to August 2019. The primary endpoint was the restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 12 months after HCC diagnosis. We used the cloneâcensorâweight approach to account for potential immortal time bias. In this study, 86 patients with palliative care consultation and 71 patients without palliative care consultation were included. The adjusted RMST difference was â29.7 (95\% confidence interval (CI): â81.7, 22.3; p-value = 0.263) days in favor of no palliative care consultation. However, palliative care consultation was associated with an increase in the prescription of symptom control medications, as well as a reduction in life-sustaining interventions and healthcare costs. Our findings suggest that palliative care consultation was associated with neither additional survival benefit nor harm in HCC patients. The misconception that it significantly accelerates the dying process should be disregarded.},

IPTW involves two main steps. First, the probabilityâor propensityâof being exposed to the risk factor or intervention of interest is calculated, given an individualâs characteristics (i.e. propensity score). Second, weights are calculated as the inverse of the propensity score. The application of these weights to the study population creates a pseudopopulation in which confounders are equally distributed across exposed and unexposed groups. We also elaborate on how weighting can be applied in longitudinal studies to deal with informative censoring and time-dependent confounding in the setting of treatment-confounder feedback.},

Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of âbest practiceâ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naÃ¯ve model-based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich-type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. Â© 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

In non-randomized studies, unadjusted estimates can lead to biased depictions due to confounding. Multiple methods to adjust survival curves for confounders exist. However, it is currently unclear which method is the most appropriate in which situation. Our goal is to compare forms of inverse probability of treatment weighting, the G-Formula, propensity score matching, empirical likelihood estimation and augmented estimators as well as their pseudo-values based counterparts in different scenarios with a focus on their bias and goodness-of-fit. We provide a short review of all methods and illustrate their usage by contrasting the survival of smokers and non-smokers, using data from the German Epidemiological Trial on Ankle-Brachial-Index. Subsequently, we compare the methods using a Monte-Carlo simulation. We consider scenarios in which correctly or incorrectly specified models for describing the treatment assignment and the time-to-event outcome are used with varying sample sizes. The bias and goodness-of-fit is determined by taking the entire survival curve into account. When used properly, all methods showed no systematic bias in medium to large samples. Cox regression based methods, however, showed systematic bias in small samples. The goodness-of-fit varied greatly between different methods and scenarios. Methods utilizing an outcome model were more efficient than other techniques, while augmented estimators using an additional treatment assignment model were unbiased when either model was correct with a goodness-of-fit comparable to other methods.

Typically, the two events are correlated. This situation has been termed semicompeting risks (e.g., Fine, Jiang, and Chappell, 2001, Biometrika 88, 907â939; Wang, 2003, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 65, 257â273), and analysis has been based on a joint survival function of two event times over the positive quadrant but with observation restricted to the upper wedge. Implicitly, this approach entertains the idea of latent failure times and leads to discussion of a marginal distribution of the nonterminal event that is not grounded in reality. We argue that, similar to models for competing risks, latent failure times should generally be avoided in modeling such data. We note that semicompeting risks have more classically been described as an illnessâdeath model and this formulation avoids any reference to latent times. We consider an illnessâdeath model with shared frailty, which in its most restrictive form is identical to the semicompeting risks model that has been proposed and analyzed, but that allows for many generalizations and the simple incorporation of covariates. Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation is used for inference and resulting estimates for the correlation parameter are compared with other proposed approaches. Asymptotic properties, simulations studies, and application to a randomized clinical trial in nasopharyngeal cancer evaluate and illustrate the methods.

Toward resolving this, we describe and illustrate the semi-competing risks framework, which refers to the general setting where scientific interest lies with some nonterminal event (eg, readmission), the occurrence of which is subject to a terminal event (eg, death). Although several statistical analysis methods have been proposed for semi-competing risks data, we describe in detail the use of illnessâdeath models primarily because of their relation to well-known methods for survival analysis and the availability of software. We also describe and consider in detail several existing approaches that could, in principle, be used to analyze semi-competing risks data, including composite end point and competing risks analyses. Throughout we illustrate the ideas and methods using data on N=49â763 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized between 2011 and 2013 with a principle discharge diagnosis of heart failure.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent a single measure, self-rated health (SRH), independently predicts long-term hospitalizations due to all causes and to cardiovascular diseases by using both the standard Cox proportional hazards model and a more robust events model. The study cohort consisted of 2,812 elderly subjects residing in New Haven, Connecticut, who were followed from 1982 to 1996 as part of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly. After adjustment for baseline risk factors, using the Cox model, a favorable SRH was associated with a significantly lowered risk for a first hospitalization for all causes (risk ratio (RR) = 0.850, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.774, 0.934) and congestive heart failure (RR = 0.599, 95\% CI: 0.426, 0.841) but not for myocardial infarction (RR = 0.882, 95\% CI: 0.565, 1.379). With the adjusted robust events model, a positive SRH was associated with a decreased risk in both a first (RR = 0.813, 95\% CI: 0.744, 0.889) and a second (RR = 0.870, 95\% CI: 0.782, 0.968) hospitalization for any cause. These results indicate that a single measurement of SRH predicts long-term patterns of hospitalization, especially for heart failure, among older adults.},

Traditional survival methods that analyze these processes separately may lead to erroneous inferences as they ignore possible dependencies. To account for the association between recurrent events and a semi-competing risk in the presence of two levels of clustering, we developed a semiparametric joint model. The Gaussian quadrature with a piecewise constant baseline hazard was used to estimate the unspecified baseline hazards and the likelihood. Simulations showed that the proposed joint model has good statistical properties (i.e., {\textless}5\% bias and 95\% coverage) compared to the shared frailty and joint frailty models when informative censoring and multiple levels of clustering were present. The proposed method was applied to data from an AIDS clinical trial to investigate the impact of antiretroviral treatment on recurrent AIDS-defining events (ADE) in the presence of a semi-competing risk of death and multi-level clustering and showed a significant dependency between ADE and death at the patient-level but not at the clinic-level.},

	abstract = {Readmission following discharge from an initial hospitalization is a key marker of quality of healthcare in the United States. For the most part, readmission has been studied among patients with âacuteâ health conditions, such as pneumonia and heart failure, with analyses based on a logistic-Normal generalized linear mixed model. NaÃ¯ve application of this model to the study of readmission among patients with âadvancedâ health conditions such as pancreatic cancer, however, is problematic because it ignores death as a competing risk. A more appropriate analysis is to imbed such a study within the semicompeting risks framework. To our knowledge, however, no comprehensive statistical methods have been developed for cluster-correlated semicompeting risks data. To resolve this gap in the literature we propose a novel hierarchical modeling framework for the analysis of cluster-correlated semicompeting risks data that permits parametric or nonparametric specifications for a range of components giving analysts substantial flexibility as they consider their own analyses. Estimation and inference is performed within the Bayesian paradigm since it facilitates the straightforward characterization of (posterior) uncertainty for all model parameters, including hospital-specific random effects. Model comparison and choice is performed via the deviance information criterion and the log-pseudo marginal likelihood statistic, both of which are based on a partially marginalized likelihood. An efficient computational scheme, based on the Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm, is developed and had been implemented in the R package SemiCompRisks. A comprehensive simulation study shows that the proposed framework performs very well in a range of data scenarios, and outperforms competitor analysis strategies. The proposed framework is motivated by and illustrated with an ongoing study of the risk of readmission among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Using data on n = 5298 patients at J=112 hospitals in the six New England states between 2000â2009, key scientific questions we consider include the role of patient-level risk factors on the risk of readmission and the extent of variation in risk across hospitals not explained by differences in patient case-mix.

	abstract = {The 30-day hospital readmission rate has been used in provider profiling for evaluating inter-provider care coordination, medical cost effectiveness, and patient quality of life. Current profiling analyzes use logistic regression to model 30-day readmission as a binary outcome, but one disadvantage of this approach is that this outcome is strongly affected by competing risks (e.g., death). Thus, one, perhaps unintended, consequence is that if two facilities have the same rates of readmission, the one with the higher rate of competing risks will have the lower 30-day readmission rate. We propose a discrete time competing risk model wherein the cause-specific readmission hazard is used to assess provider-level effects. This approach takes account of the timing of events and focuses on the readmission rates which are of primary interest. The quality measure, then is a standardized readmission ratio, akin to a standardized mortality ratio. This measure is not systematically affected by the rate of competing risks. To facilitate the estimation and inference of a large number of provider effects, we develop an efficient Blockwise Inversion Newton algorithm, and a stabilized robust score test that overcomes the conservative nature of the classical robust score test. An application to dialysis patients demonstrates improved profiling, model fitting, and outlier detection over existing methods.},

	abstract = {Background
Different study designs and population size may require different sample size for logistic regression. This study aims to propose sample size guidelines for logistic regression based on observational studies with large population.

Methods
We estimated the minimum sample size required based on evaluation from real clinical data to evaluate the accuracy between statistics derived and the actual parameters. Nagelkerke r-squared and coefficients derived were compared with their respective parameters.

Results
With a minimum sample size of 500, results showed that the differences between the sample estimates and the population was sufficiently small. Based on an audit from a medium size of population, the differences were within Â± 0.5 for coefficients and Â± 0.02 for Nagelkerke r-squared. Meanwhile for large population, the differences are within Â± 1.0 for coefficients and Â± 0.02 for Nagelkerke r-squared.

Conclusions
For observational studies with large population size that involve logistic regression in the analysis, taking a minimum sample size of 500 is necessary to derive the statistics that represent the parameters. The other recommended rules of thumb are EPV of 50 and formula; n = 100 + 50i where i refers to number of independent variables in the final model.},

Management guidelines have encouraged primary care referral for spinal manipulation, but the evidence base is weak. More economic evaluations alongside pragmatic trials have been recommended.Objective. Our aim was to assess the costâutility of a practice-based osteopathy clinic for subacute spinal pain.Methods. A costâutility analysis was performed alongside a pragmatic single-centre randomized controlled trial in a primary care osteopathy clinic accepting referrals from 14 neighbouring practices in North West Wales. Patients with back pain of 2â12 weeks duration were randomly allocated to treatment with osteopathy plus usual GP care or usual GP care alone. Costs were measured from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. All primary and secondary health care interventions recorded in GP notes were collected for the study period. We calculated quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains based on EQ-5D responses from patients in the trial, and then cost per QALY ratios. Confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping.Results. Osteopathy plus usual GP care was more effective but resulted in more health care costs than usual GP care alone. The point estimate of the incremental cost per QALY ratio was Â£3560 (80\% CI Â£542âÂ£77 100). Sensitivity analysis examining spine-related costs alone and total costs excluding outliers resulted in lower cost per QALY ratios.Conclusion. A primary care osteopathy clinic may be a cost-effective addition to usual GP care, but this conclusion was subject to considerable random error. Rigorous multi-centre studies are needed to assess the generalizability of this approach.},

	abstract = {Purpose Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are used increasingly for individual patient management. Identifying which PRO scores require a clinicianâs attention is an ongoing challenge. Previous research used a needs assessment to identify EORTC-QLQ-C30 cutoff scores representing unmet needs. This analysis attempted to replicate the previous findings in a new and larger sample. Methods This analysis used data from 408 Japanese ambulatory breast cancer patients who completed the QLQ-C30 and Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form34 (SCNS-SF34). Applying the methods used previously, SCNS-SF34 item/domain scores were dichotomized as no versus some unmet need. We calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate QLQ-C30 scoresâ ability to discriminate between patients with no versus some unmet need based on SCNS-SF34 items/domains. For QLQ-C30 domains with AUC C 0.70, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of various cutoffs for identifying unmet needs. We hypothesized that compared to our original analysis, (1) the same six QLQ-C30 domains would have AUC C 0.70, (2) the same SCNS-SF34 items would be best discriminated by QLQ-C30 scores, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity of our original cutoff scores would be supported. Results The findings from our original analysis were supported. The same six domains with AUC C 0.70 in the original analysis had AUC C 0.70 in this new sample, and the same SCNS-SF34 item was best discriminated by QLQ-C30 scores. Cutoff scores were identified with sensitivity C0.84 and specificity C0.54. Conclusion Given these findingsâ concordance with our previous analysis, these QLQ-C30 cutoffs could be implemented in clinical practice and their usefulness evaluated},

Discussion: In this paper we will provide a detailed exploration of the key aspects of sensitivity analyses including: 1) what sensitivity analyses are, why they are needed, and how often they are used in practice; 2) the different types of sensitivity analyses that one can do, with examples from the literature; 3) some frequently asked questions about sensitivity analyses; and 4) some suggestions on how to report the results of sensitivity analyses in clinical trials. Summary: When reporting on a clinical trial, we recommend including planned or posthoc sensitivity analyses, the corresponding rationale and results along with the discussion of the consequences of these analyses on the overall findings of the study.},

Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse ({\textgreater}6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews.},

	abstract = {Missing data is a common occurrence in clinical research. Missing data occurs when the value of the variables of interest are not measured or recorded for all subjects in the sample. Common approaches to addressing the presence of missing data include complete-case analyses, where subjects with missing data are excluded, and mean-value imputation, where missing values are replaced with the mean value of that variable in those subjects for whom it is not missing. However, in many settings, these approaches can lead to biased estimates of statistics (eg, of regression coefficients) and/or confidence intervals that are artificially narrow. Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach for addressing the presence of missing data. With MI, multiple plausible values of a given variable are imputed or filled in for each subject who has missing data for that variable. This results in the creation of multiple completed data sets. Identical statistical analyses are conducted in each of these complete data sets and the results are pooled across complete data sets. We provide an introduction to MI and discuss issues in its implementation, including developing the imputation model, how many imputed data sets to create, and addressing derived variables. We illustrate the application of MI through an analysis of data on patients hospitalised with heart failure. We focus on developing a model to estimate the probability of 1-year mortality in the presence of missing data. Statistical software code for conducting MI in R, SAS, and Stata are provided.},

For time-to-event data, right censoring (data only observed up to a certain point of time) is common and easy to recognize. Methods that use right censored data, such as the KaplanâMeier estimator and the Cox proportional hazard model, are well established. Time-to-event data can also be left truncated, which arises when patients are excluded from the sample because their events occur before a specific milestone, potentially resulting in an immortal time bias. For example, in a study evaluating the association between biomarker status and overall survival, patients who did not live long enough to receive a genomic test were not observed in the study. Left truncation causes selection bias and often leads to an overestimate of survival time. In this tutorial, we used a nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified database to demonstrate how to analyze left truncated and right censored data without bias using example code from SAS and R.},

	abstract = {Background The estimand for a clinical trial is a precise definition of the treatment effect to be estimated. Traditionally, estimates of treatment effects are based on either an ITT analysis or a per-protocol analysis. However, there are important clinical questions which are not addressed by either of these analyses. For example, consider a trial where patients take a rescue medication. The ITT analysis includes data after use of rescue, while the per-protocol analysis excludes these patients altogether. Neither of these analyses addresses the important question of what the treatment effect would have been if patients did not take rescue medication. Main text Trial estimands provide a broader perspective compared to the limitations of ITT and per-protocol analysis. Trial treatment effects depend on how events occurring after treatment initiation such as use of alternative medication or discontinuation of the intervention are included in the definition. These events can be accounted for in different ways, depending on the clinical question of interest. Conclusion The estimand framework is an important step forward in improving the clarity and transparency of clinical trials. The centrality of estimands to clinical trials is currently not reflected in methods recommended by the Cochrane group or the CONSORT statement, the current standard for reporting clinical trials in medical journals. We encourage revisions to these guidelines.},

	abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is wellâestablished if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10â30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the changeâinâestimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of pâvalues or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (lowâdimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

	abstract = {When reporting results from randomized experiments, researchers often choose to present a per-protocol effect in addition to an intention-to-treat effect. However, these per-protocol effects are often described retrospectively, for example, comparing outcomes among individuals who adhered to their assigned treatment strategy throughout the study. This retrospective definition of a per-protocol effect is often confounded and cannot be interpreted causally because it encounters treatment-confounder feedback loops, where past confounders affect future treatment, and current treatment affects future confounders. Per-protocol effects estimated using this method are highly susceptible to the placebo paradox, also called the âhealthy adherersâ bias, where individuals who adhere to placebo appear to have better survival than those who donât. This result is generally not due to a benefit of placebo, but rather is most often the result of uncontrolled confounding. Here, we aim to provide an overview to causal inference for survival outcomes with time-varying exposures for static interventions using inverse probability weighting. The basic concepts described here can also apply to other types of exposure strategies, although these may require additional design or analytic considerations. We provide a workshop guide with solutions manual, fully reproducible R, SAS, and Stata code, and a simulated dataset on a GitHub repository for the reader to explore.},

Nonadherence also may occur when the clinician is unable to complete the assigned therapy (eg, a surgical procedure) as intended.The CABANA clinical trial published in JAMA by Packer et al was difficult to interpret because of nonadherence with the treatment protocol that resulted from substantial crossover between groups. In this trial, patients with atrial fibrillation were randomized to either undergo catheter ablation or receive conventional medical therapy. Of the 1108 participants randomized to ablation, 102 (9\%) did not receive the procedure. Of the 1096 patients randomized to drug therapy, 301 (27\%) underwent ablation during the follow-up period, resulting in nonadherence to assigned treatment in both groups of the study. Interpretation of the effect of catheter ablation on atrial fibrillation differed based on alternate ways of analyzing the trials results. Intention-to-treat (ITT), per-protocol (PP), and as-treated (AT) approaches to analysis differ in how the included patient population and treatment assignments are defined, with important implications for interpretation of treatment effects in clinical trials.},

The BOIN design is easy to implement in a way similar to the 3 + 3 design, but is more flexible for choosing the target toxicity rate and cohort size and yields a substantially better performance that is comparable with that of more complex model-based designs. The BOIN design contains the 3 + 3 design and the accelerated titration design as special cases, thus linking itto established phase I approaches. A numerical study shows that the BOIN design generally outperforms the 3 + 3 design and the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design. The BOIN design is more likely than the 3 + 3 design to correctly select the MTD and allocate more patients to the MTD. Compared with the mTPI design, the BOIN design has a substantially lower risk of overdosing patients and generally a higher probability of correctly selecting the MTD.

Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Methods: Longitudinal data from 310 lung cancer patients across three hospitals in China were assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (T1âT4). Descriptive statistics characterised patient demographics, clinical characteristics, levels of FCR and QOL. A linear mixed-effects model was employed to analyse FCR trajectories, identify influencing factors on these trajectories, and predict the impact of FCR on QOL. Results: FCR changed significantly over time, with a slight decrease during T1âT2, an increase at T3 and gradual decline at T4. Higher fear levels were associated with female sex, suburban or rural residency, being a family breadwinner, presence of comorbidities and negative coping behaviours, and low family resilience. QOL negatively correlated with FCR, and FCR predicted lower QOL. Conclusions: At 3 and 6 months postoperatively, lung cancer patients, especially women, suburban or rural residents, family breadwinners, those with comorbidities, negative coping behaviours and low family resilience, reported high levels of FCR. Healthcare providers should pay special attention to lung cancer patients especially during the period of 3â6 months post-surgery and offer tailored interventions to improve their QOL. Implications for the Profession and Patient Care: Understanding the FCR trajectories, its influencing factors and its negative impacts on QOL can guide the development of targeted interventions to reduce fear and enhance well-being in patients with cancer. Impact: Identifying the trajectories and influencing factors of fear of lung cancer recurrence in patients at different time points informs future research on targeted interventions to improve QOL. Reporting Method: The study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Statement on Reporting Observational Longitudinal Research.},

	abstract = {The Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) can be used for new drug application studies as well as secondarily for creating a clinical research data warehouse to leverage clinical research study data across studies conducted within the same disease area. However, currently not all clinical research uses Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) beginning in the set-up phase of the study. Once already initiated, clinical studies that have not utilized CDASH are difficult to map in the SDTM format. In addition, most electronic data capture (EDC) systems are not equipped to export data in SDTM format; therefore, in many cases, statistical software is used to generate SDTM datasets from accumulated clinical data. In order to facilitate efficient secondary use of accumulated clinical research data using SDTM, it is necessary to develop a new tool to enable mapping of information for SDTM, even during or after the clinical research. REDCap is an EDC system developed by Vanderbilt University and is used globally by over 2100 institutions across 108 countries. In this study, we developed a simulated clinical trial to evaluate a tool called REDCap2SDTM that maps information in the Field Annotation of REDCap to SDTM and executes data conversion, including when data must be pivoted to accommodate the SDTM format, dynamically, by parsing the mapping information using R. We confirmed that generating SDTM data and the define.xml file from REDCap using REDCap2SDTM was possible. Conventionally, generation of SDTM data and the define.xml file from EDC systems requires the creation of individual programs for each clinical study. However, our proposed method can be used to generate this data and file dynamically without programming because it only involves entering the mapping information into the Field Annotation, and additional data into specific files. Our proposed method is adaptable not only to new drug application studies but also to all types of research, including observational and public health studies. Our method is also adaptable to clinical data collected with CDASH at the beginning of a study in non-standard format. We believe that this tool will reduce the workload of new drug application studies and will support data sharing and reuse of clinical research data in academia.},

	abstract = {Traditional sample size calculations for randomized clinical trials depend on somewhat arbitrarily chosen factors, such as type I and II errors. Type I error, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference when it is true, is most often set to 0.05, regardless of the cost of such an error. In addition, the traditional use of 0.2 for the type II error means that the money and effort spent on the trial will be wasted 20 per cent of the time, even when the true treatment difference is equal to the smallest clinically important one and, again, will not reflect the cost of making such an error. An effectiveness trial (otherwise known as a pragmatic trial or management trial) is essentially an effort to inform decision-making, i.e. should treatment be adopted over standard? As such, a decision theoretic approach will lead to an optimal sample size determination. Using incremental net benefit and the theory of the expected value of information, and taking a societal perspective, it is shown how to determine the sample size that maximizes the difference between the cost of doing the trial and the value of the information gained from the results. The methods are illustrated using examples from oncology and obstetrics. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the approval process for new weight management therapies, regulators typically require estimates of effect size. Usually, as with other drug evaluations, the placebo-adjusted treatment effect (i.e., the difference between weight losses with pharmacotherapy and placebo, when given as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention) is provided from data in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). At first glance, this may seem appropriate and straightforward. However, weight loss is not a simple direct drug effect, but is also mediated by other factors such as changes in diet and physical activity. Interpreting observed differences between treatment arms in weight management RCTs can be challenging; intercurrent events that occur after treatment initiation may affect the interpretation of results at the end of treatment. Utilizing estimands helps to address these uncertainties and improve transparency in clinical trial reporting by better matching the treatment-effect estimates to the scientific and/or clinical questions of interest. Estimands aim to provide an indication of trial outcomes that might be expected in the same patients under different conditions. This article reviews how intercurrent events during weight management trials can influence placebo-adjusted treatment effects, depending on how they are accounted for and how missing data are handled. The most appropriate method for statistical analysis is also discussed, including assessment of the last observation carried forward approach, and more recent methods, such as multiple imputation and mixed models for repeated measures. The use of each of these approaches, and that of estimands, is discussed in the context of the SCALE phase 3a and 3b RCTs evaluating the effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg for the treatment of obesity.},

Previous trials focused on advanced disease, and less is known about patients across a broad range of stages. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of a nurse-led telephone-based primary palliative care intervention that focused on patients across a broad range of stages. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a multisite randomized controlled trial in the United States involving patients diagnosed within two months with any stage or histology of lung cancer to compare the effects of a telephone-based palliative care intervention delivered by registered nurses trained in primary palliative care versus usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Scale Total Outcome Index (FACT-L TOI), which measures QOL and symptoms. We estimated having 80\% power to detect a 5-point change from baseline to three months. Secondary outcome was a change in satisfaction of care, measured by the FAMCARE-P13. Results: A total of 151 patients were enrolled over 30 months. Patients were, on average, male (98\%), age 70 years, White (85\%), and 36\% diagnosed with stage I-II, and 64\% had stage III-IV. In comparison to usual care, patients in the nurse-led intervention did not report improvement in QOL from baseline to three months follow-up or demonstrate differences in treatment effect by site or cancer stage: FACT-L TOI 1.03 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -3.98 to 6.04). Satisfaction with care did not significantly improve: 0.66 (95\% CI: -2.01 to 3.33). Conclusions: Among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, a nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention did not significantly improve QOL, symptom burden, or satisfaction of care. In contrast to several clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of delivering specialty palliative care with disease-modifying treatments on QOL among patients with advanced lung cancer, this intervention did not significantly improve QOL among patients with any stage lung cancer. Future research should identify which specific components of primary palliative care improve outcomes for patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Distinct problems in the analysis of failure times with competing causes of failure include the estimation of treatment or exposure effects on specific failure types, the study of interrelations among failure types, and the estimation of failure rates for some causes given the removal of certain other failure types. The usual formation of these problems is in terms of conceptual or latent failure times for each failure type. This approach is criticized on the basis of unwarranted assumptions, lack of physical interpretation and identifiability problems. An alternative approach utilizing cause-specific hazard functions for observable quantities, including time-dependent covariates, is proposed. Cause-specific hazard functions are shown to be the basic estimable quantities in the competing risks framework. A method, involving the estimation of parameters that relate time-dependent risk indicators for some causes to cause-specific hazard functions for other causes, is proposed for the study of interrelations among failure types. Further, it is argued that the problem of estimation of failure rates under the removal of certain causes is not well posed until a mechanism for cause removal is specified. Following such a specification, one will sometimes be in a position to make sensible extrapolations from available data to situations involving cause removal. A clinical program in bone marrow transplantation for leukemia provides a setting for discussion and illustration of each of these ideas. Failure due to censoring in a survivorship study leads to further discussion.},

We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysisâthe theoretical estimandâin precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation.

The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. Methods: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. Results: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74\% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36\% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20\%, the population-level summary measure in 34\%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60\% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32\% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80\% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28\% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred. Conclusions: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor, and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research and reporting, this urgently needs to change.},

	abstract = {With explanatory covariates, the standard analysis for competing risks data involves modeling the cause-specific hazard functions via a proportional hazards assumption. Unfortunately, the cause-specific hazard function does not have a direct interpretation in terms of survival probabilities for the particular failure type. In recent years many clinicians have begun using the cumulative incidence function, the marginal failure probabilities for a particular cause, which is intuitively appealing and more easily explained to the nonstatistician. The cumulative incidence is especially relevant in cost-effectiveness analyses in which the survival probabilities are needed to determine treatment utility. Previously, authors have considered methods for combining estimates of the cause-specific hazard functions under the proportional hazards formulation. However, these methods do not allow the analyst to directly assess the effect of a covariate on the marginal probability function. In this article we propose a novel semiparametric proportional hazards model for the subdistribution. Using the partial likelihood principle and weighting techniques, we derive estimation and inference procedures for the finite-dimensional regression parameter under a variety of censoring scenarios. We give a uniformly consistent estimator for the predicted cumulative incidence for an individual with certain covariates; confidence intervals and bands can be obtained analytically or with an easy-to-implement simulation technique. To contrast the two approaches, we analyze a dataset from a breast cancer clinical trial under both models. Â© 1999 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen the publication of a number of new proposals for the design of phase I trials of anticancer agents. The purpose of these proposals has been to address ethical concerns about treating excessive numbers of patients at subtherapeu-tic doses of a new agent and to increase the overall efficiency of the process while enhancing the precision of the recommended phase II dose. In early 1998, a workshop of phase I investigators was held under the sponsorship of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Wallingford, CT) to review the experience to date with novel phase I methodologies, with a particular focus on their efficiency and safety. This report summarizes the material presented. It was concluded that for phase I trials of antineoplastics (cytotox-ics), which begin at 0.1 mouse-equivalent LD10 doses, evidence to date suggests that the historic approach of using a modified Fibonacci escalation and three patients per dose level is not necessary and is seldom used. One patient per dose level and more rapid escalation schemes, both empirically based and statistically based, are commonly used with apparent safety. There remain questions, however: Which of the dose escalation schemes is optimal? Are there alternatives to toxicity as a phase I end point, and will these end points be reliable in defining active doses? Answering these questions in a reasonable time frame will be important if new anticancer agents are not to suffer undue delays in phase I evaluation.},

	abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry and its global regulators have routinely used frequentist statistical methods, such as null hypothesis significance testing and p values, for evaluation and approval of new treatments. The clinical drug development process, however, with its accumulation of data over time, can be well suited for the use of Bayesian statistical approaches that explicitly incorporate existing data into clinical trial design, analysis and decision-making. Such approaches, if used appropriately, have the potential to substantially reduce the time and cost of bringing innovative medicines to patients, as well as to reduce the exposure of patients in clinical trials to ineffective or unsafe treatment regimens. Nevertheless, despite advances in Bayesian methodology, the availability of the necessary computational power and growing amounts of relevant existing data that could be used, Bayesian methods remain underused in the clinical development and regulatory review of new therapies. Here, we highlight the value of Bayesian methods in drug development, discuss barriers to their application and recommend approaches to address them. Our aim is to engage stakeholders in the process of considering when the use of existing data is appropriate and how Bayesian methods can be implemented more routinely as an effective tool for doing so.},

	abstract = {Many outcomes of interest in the social and health sciences, as well as in modern applications in computational social science and experimentation on social media platforms, are ordinal and do not have a meaningful scale. Causal analyses that leverage this type of data, termed ordinal non-numeric, require careful treatment, as much of the classical potential outcomes literature is concerned with estimation and hypothesis testing for outcomes whose relative magnitudes are well defined. Here, we propose a class of finite population causal estimands that depend on conditional distributions of the potential outcomes, and provide an interpretable summary of causal effects when no scale is available. We formulate a relaxation of the Fisherian sharp null hypothesis of constant effect that accommodates the scale-free nature of ordinal non-numeric data. We develop a Bayesian procedure to estimate the proposed causal estimands that leverages the rank likelihood. We illustrate these methods with an application to educational outcomes in the General Social Survey.},

In trials with an ordinal outcome, which is categorized as more than two, the causal effect can be identified by assuming that the potential outcomes are independent and that the two treatment arms are exchangeable. In this article, we propose a Bayesian approach to causal inference that does not rely on these two assumptions. To achieve this purpose, we use a randomization-based approach and response type. Then, the likelihood function is derived by physical randomization in which subjects who belong to a response type are randomly assigned to the treatment or control, with no modeling assumption on the outcome. Our approach can derive not only the posterior distribution of the causal effect but also that of the number of subjects in each response type. The proposed approach is illustrated with two examples from randomized clinical trials.},

During step 1, patients completed a measure of quality of life (QOL; Functional Assessment of Cancer TherapyâLung [FACT-L]; range, 0-136, with higher scores indicating better QOL) every 6 weeks, and those with a 10-point or greater decrease from baseline were stepped up to meet with the palliative care clinician every 4 weeks (intervention step 2). Patients assigned to early palliative care had palliative care visits every 4 weeks after enrollment.Noninferiority (marginâ=ââ4.5) of the effect of stepped vs early palliative care on patient-reported QOL on the FACT-L at week 24.The sample (nâ=â507) mostly included patients with advanced nonâsmall cell lung cancer (78.3\%; mean age, 66.5 years; 51.4\% female; 84.6\% White). The mean number of palliative care visits by week 24 was 2.4 for stepped palliative care and 4.7 for early palliative care (adjusted mean difference, â2.3; Pâ\&lt;â.001). FACT-L scores at week 24 for the stepped palliative care group were noninferior to scores among those receiving early palliative care (adjusted FACT-L mean score, 100.6 vs 97.8, respectively; difference, 2.9; lower 1-sided 95\% confidence limit, â0.1; Pâ\&lt;â.001 for noninferiority). Although the rate of end-of-life care communication was also noninferior between groups, noninferiority was not demonstrated for days in hospice (adjusted mean, 19.5 with stepped palliative care vs 34.6 with early palliative care; Pâ=â.91).A stepped-care model, with palliative care visits occurring only at key points in patientsâ cancer trajectories and using a decrement in QOL to trigger more intensive palliative care exposure, resulted in fewer palliative care visits without diminishing the benefits for patientsâ QOL. While stepped palliative care was associated with fewer days in hospice, it is a more scalable way to deliver early palliative care to enhance patient-reported outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03337399},

	abstract = {Quantifying the causal effects of continuous exposures on outcomes of interest is critical for social, economic, health, and medical research. However, most existing software packages focus on binary exposures. We develop the CausalGPS R package that implements a collection of algorithms to provide algorithmic solutions for causal inference with continuous exposures. CausalGPS implements a causal inference workflow, with algorithms based on generalized propensity scores (GPS) as the core, extending propensity scores (the probability of a unit being exposed given pre-exposure covariates) from binary to continuous exposures. As the first step, the package implements efficient and flexible estimations of the GPS, allowing multiple user-specified modeling options. As the second step, the package provides two ways to adjust for confounding: weighting and matching, generating weighted and matched data sets, respectively. Lastly, the package provides built-in functions to fit flexible parametric, semi-parametric, or non-parametric regression models on the weighted or matched data to estimate the exposure-response function relating the outcome with the exposures. The computationally intensive tasks are implemented in C++, and efficient shared-memory parallelization is achieved by OpenMP API. This paper outlines the main components of the CausalGPS R package and demonstrates its application to assess the effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on educational attainment using zip code-level data from the contiguous United States from 2000-2016.},

The generalized propensity score is an extension of the propensity score for use with quantitative exposures (e.g., dose or quantity of medication, income, years of education). A crucial component of any propensity score analysis is that of balance assessment. This entails assessing the degree to which conditioning on the propensity score (via matching, weighting, or stratification) has balanced measured baseline covariates between exposure groups. Methods for balance assessment have been well described and are frequently implemented when using the propensity score with binary exposures. However, there is a paucity of information on how to assess baseline covariate balance when using the generalized propensity score. We describe how methods based on the standardized difference can be adapted for use with quantitative exposures when using the generalized propensity score. We also describe a method based on assessing the correlation between the quantitative exposure and each covariate in the sample when weighted using generalized propensity score -based weights. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods. We also compared two different methods of estimating the generalized propensity score: ordinary least squared regression and the covariate balancing propensity score method. We illustrate the application of these methods using data on patients hospitalized with a heart attack with the quantitative exposure being creatinine level.},

The use of methods based on the GPS was compared with the use of G-computation. All methods resulted in essentially unbiased estimation of the population dose-response function. However, GPS-based weighting tended to result in estimates that displayed greater variability and had higher mean squared error when the magnitude of confounding was strong. Of the methods based on the GPS, covariate adjustment using the GPS tended to result in estimates with lower variability and mean squared error when the magnitude of confounding was strong. We illustrate the application of these methods by estimating the effect of average neighborhood income on the probability of death within 1 year of hospitalization for an acute myocardial infarction.},

In this article, we review the available methods for estimating the doseâresponse curve for a quantitative exposure, which include ordinary regression based on an outcome regression model, inverse propensity weighting and stratification based on a propensity function model, and an augmented inverse propensity weighting method that is doubly robust with respect to the two models. We note that an outcome regression model often imposes an implicit constraint on the doseâresponse curve, and propose a flexible modeling strategy that avoids constraining the doseâresponse curve. We also propose two new methods: a weighted regression method that combines ordinary regression with inverse propensity weighting and a stratified regression method that combines ordinary regression with stratification. The proposed methods are similar to the augmented inverse propensity weighting method in the sense of double robustness, but easier to implement and more generally applicable. The methods are illustrated with an obstetric example and compared in simulation studies.},

	abstract = {Background
The modified frailty index (mFI-11) is a NSQIP-based 11-factor index that has been proven to adequately reflect frailty and predict mortality and morbidity. These 11 factors, made of 16 variables, map to the original 70-item Canada Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index. In past years, certain NSQIP variables have been removed from the database; as of 2015, only 5 of the original 11 factors remained. The predictive power and usefulness of these 5 factors in an index (mFI-5) have not been proven in past literature. The goal of our study was to compare the mFI-5 to the mFI-11 in terms of value and predictive ability for mortality, postoperative infection, and unplanned 30-day readmission.
Study Design
The mFI was calculated by dividing the number of factors present for a patient by the number of available factors for which there were no missing data. Spearman's rho was used to assess correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11. Predictive models, using both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions, were created for each outcome for 9 surgical sub-specialties using 2012 NSQIP data, the last year all mFI-11 variables existed.
Results
Correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11 was above 0.9 across all surgical specialties except for cardiac and vascular surgery. Adjusted and unadjusted models showed similar c-statistics for mFI-5 and mFI-11, and strong predictive ability for mortality and postoperative complications.
Conclusions
The mFI-5 and the mFI-11 are equally effective predictors in all sub-specialties and the mFI-5 is a strong predictor of mortality and postoperative complications. It has credibility for future use to study frailty within the NSQIP database. It also has potential in other databases and for clinical use.},

For practitioners, the framework, illustrative examples and code should equip them with a practical approach to address the issues raised by missing data (particularly using multiple imputation), alongside an overview of how the various approaches in the literature relate. In particular, we describe how multiple imputation can be readily used for sensitivity analyses, which are still infrequently performed. For those interested in more formal derivations, we give outline arguments for key results, use simple examples to show how methods relate, and references for full details.

	abstract = {Background: Patient navigation has been an effective intervention to increase cancer screening rates. This study focuses on predicting outcomes of screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer among African Americans using different patient navigation formats.
Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, patients more than 50 years of age without signiï¬cant comorbidities were randomized into three navigation groups: peer-patient navigation (n Â¼ 181), pro-patient navigation (n Â¼ 123), and standard (n Â¼ 46). Pro-patient navigations were health care professionals who conducted culturally targeted navigation, whereas peer-patient navigations were community members trained in patient navigation who also discussed their personal experiences with screening colonoscopy. Two assessments gathered sociodemographic, medical, and intrapersonal information.
Results: Screening colonoscopy completion rate was 75.7\% across all groups with no signiï¬cant differences in completion between the three study arms. Annual income more than \$10,000 was an independent predictor of screening colonoscopy adherence. Unexpectedly, low social inï¬uence also predicted screening colonoscopy completion.
Conclusions: In an urban African American population, patient navigation was effective in increasing screening colonoscopy rates to 15\% above the national average, regardless of patient navigation type or content. Impact: Because patient navigation successfully increases colonoscopy adherence, cultural targeting may not be necessary in some populations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(9); 1577â87.

            Unmeasured confounding is a key threat to reliable causal inference based on observational studies. Motivated from two powerful natural experiment devices, the instrumental variables and difference-in-differences, we propose a new method called instrumented difference-in-differences that explicitly leverages exogenous randomness in an exposure trend to estimate the average and conditional average treatment effect in the presence of unmeasured confounding. We develop the identification assumptions using the potential outcomes framework. We propose a Wald estimator and a class of multiply robust and efficient semiparametric estimators, with provable consistency and asymptotic normality. In addition, we extend the instrumented difference-in-differences to a two-sample design to facilitate investigations of delayed treatment effect and provide a measure of weak identification. We demonstrate our results in simulated and real datasets.},

Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanismâa probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.},

	abstract = {To obtain valid inference following stratified randomisation, treatment effects should be estimated with adjustment for stratification variables. Stratification sometimes requires categorisation of a continuous prognostic variable (eg, age), which raises the question: should adjustment be based on randomisation categories or underlying continuous values? In practice, adjustment for randomisation categories is more common. We reviewed trials published in general medical journals and found none of the 32 trials that stratified randomisation based on a continuous variable adjusted for continuous values in the primary analysis. Using data simulation, this article evaluates the performance of different adjustment strategies for continuous and binary outcomes where the covariate-outcome relationship (via the link function) was either linear or non-linear. Given the utility of covariate adjustment for addressing missing data, we also considered settings with complete or missing outcome data. Analysis methods included linear or logistic regression with no adjustment for the stratification variable, adjustment for randomisation categories, or adjustment for continuous values assuming a linear covariate-outcome relationship or allowing for non-linearity using fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines. Unadjusted analysis performed poorly throughout. Adjustment approaches that misspecified the underlying covariate-outcome relationship were less powerful and, alarmingly, biased in settings where the stratification variable predicted missing outcome data. Adjustment for randomisation categories tends to involve the highest degree of misspecification, and so should be avoided in practice. To guard against misspecification, we recommend use of flexible approaches such as fractional polynomials and restricted cubic splines when adjusting for continuous stratification variables in randomised trials.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Appropriate and timely lifelong access to healthcare following a spinal cord injury (SCI) is critical, yet unmet healthcare needs in this population are common. Poor experiences with healthcare providers can be a barrier to health-seeking behaviour, and we hypothesised that there would be an association between unmet healthcare needs and care experiences. This study aimed to: (1) describe healthcare provider utilisation in the past year, unmet care needs and satisfaction with healthcare services; (2) explore the association between experiences with healthcare providers and unmet healthcare needs; and (3) explore the association between healthcare provider utilisation and participant characteristics, including unmet healthcare needs. SETTING: Community.
METHODS: Analysis of data for 1579 Australians aged â¥ 18, who were â¥ 1-year post-SCI and living in the community. Bayesian penalised regression was used to model six binary outcomes: unmet healthcare needs; the use of general practitioners (GPs), allied health practitioners, rehabilitation specialists; medical specialists; and hospitalisations in the past 12-months.
RESULTS: Unmet needs were reported by 17\% of participants, with service cost the common deterrent. There was evidence of an effect for provider experiences on unmet healthcare needs, but no evidence that unmet healthcare needs was associated with the use of GPs, allied health practitioners, and rehabilitation or medical specialists.
CONCLUSIONS: Unmet healthcare needs were reported in the context of high healthcare use and large proportions of secondary conditions in a cohort with long-term SCI. Improved health access for people with SCI include better primary-secondary care collaboration is needed. Spinal Cord; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-024-00997-4},

	abstract = {Background: We review three common methods to estimate predicted probabilities following confounder-adjusted logistic regression: marginal standardization (predicted probabilities summed to a weighted average reflecting the confounder distribution in the target population); prediction at the modes (conditional predicted probabilities calculated by setting each confounder to its modal value); and prediction at the means (predicted probabilities calculated by setting each confounder to its mean value). That each method corresponds to a different target population is underappreciated in practice. Specifically, prediction at the means is often incorrectly interpreted as estimating average probabilities for the overall study population, and furthermore yields nonsensical estimates in the presence of dichotomous confounders. Default commands in popular statistical software packages often lead to inadvertent misapplication of prediction at the means.Methods: Using an applied example, we demonstrate discrepancies in predicted probabilities across these methods, discuss implications for interpretation and provide syntax for SAS and Stata.Results: Marginal standardization allows inference to the total population from which data are drawn. Prediction at the modes or means allows inference only to the relevant stratum of observations. With dichotomous confounders, prediction at the means corresponds to a stratum that does not include any real-life observations.Conclusions: Marginal standardization is the appropriate method when making inference to the overall population. Other methods should be used with caution, and prediction at the means should not be used with binary confounders. Stata, but not SAS, incorporates simple methods for marginal standardization.},

	abstract = {Background Health-related quality of life metrics evaluate treatments in ways that matter to patients, so are often included in randomised clinical trials (hereafter trials). Multimorbidity, where individuals have 2 or more conditions, is negatively associated with quality of life. However, whether multimorbidity predicts change over time or modifies treatment effects for quality of life is unknown. Therefore, clinicians and guideline developers are uncertain about the applicability of trial findings to people with multimorbidity. We examined whether comorbidity count (higher counts indicating greater multimorbidity) (i) is associated with quality of life at baseline; (ii) predicts change in quality of life over time; and/or (iii) modifies treatment effects on quality of life. Methods and findings Included trials were registered on the United States trials registry for selected index medical conditions and drug classes, phase 2/3, 3 or 4, had â¥300 participants, a nonrestrictive upper age limit, and were available on 1 of 2 trial repositories on 21 November 2016 and 18 May 2018, respectively. Of 124 meeting these criteria, 56 trials (33,421 participants, 16 index conditions, and 23 drug classes) collected a generic quality of life outcome measure (35 EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D), 31 36-item short form survey (SF-36) with 10 collecting both). Blinding and completeness of follow up were examined for each trial. Using trials where individual participant data (IPD) was available from 2 repositories, a comorbidity count was calculated from medical history and/or prescriptions data. Linear regressions were fitted for the association between comorbidity count and (i) quality of life at baseline; (ii) change in quality of life during trial follow up; and (iii) treatment effects on quality of life. These results were then combined in Bayesian linear models. Posterior samples were summarised via the mean, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as credible intervals (95\% CI) and via the proportion with values less than 0 as the probability (PBayes) of a negative association. All results are in standardised units (obtained by dividing the EQ-5D/SF-36 estimates by published population standard deviations). Per additional comorbidity, adjusting for age and sex, across all index conditions and treatment comparisons, comorbidity count was associated with lower quality of life at baseline and with a decline in quality of life over time (EQ-5D â0.02 [95\% CI â0.03 to â0.01], PBayes {\textgreater} 0.999). Associations were similar, but with wider 95\% CIs crossing the null for SF-36-PCS and SF-36-MCS (â0.05 [â0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.956 and â0.05 [â0.10 to 0.01], PBayes = 0.966, respectively). Importantly, there was no evidence of any interaction between comorbidity count and treatment efficacy for either EQ-5D or SF-36 (EQ-5D â0.0035 [95\% CI â0.0153 to â0.0065], PBayes = 0.746; SF-36-MCS (â0.0111 [95\% CI â0.0647 to 0.0416], PBayes = 0.70 and SF-36-PCS â0.0092 [95\% CI â0.0758 to 0.0476], PBayes = 0.631. Conclusions Treatment effects on quality of life did not differ by multimorbidity (measured via a comorbidity count) at baselineâfor the medical conditions studied, types and severity of comorbidities and level of quality of life at baseline, suggesting that evidence from clinical trials is likely to be applicable to settings with (at least modestly) higher levels of comorbidity.

Most simulation studies to date evaluating mediation analysis in multilevel data considered scenarios that do not match the expected numbers of level 1 and level 2 units typically encountered in experimental studies, and no study to date has compared resampling and Bayesian methods for constructing intervals for the indirect effect in this context. We conducted a simulation study to compare statistical properties of interval estimates of the indirect effect obtained using four bootstrap and two Bayesian methods in the 1-1-1 mediation model with and without random effects. Bayesian credibility intervals had coverage closest to the nominal value and no instances of excessive Type I error rates, but lower power than resampling methods. Findings indicated that the pattern of performance for resampling methods often depended on the presence of random effects. We provide suggestions for selecting an interval estimator for the indirect effect depending on the most important statistical property for a given study, as well as code in R for implementing all methods evaluated in the simulation study.

	abstract = {Introduction
The care for many patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Netherlands, is contracted by a local care group. The healthcare providers, who collectively shape a care group, provide protocolled diabetes care. Differences exist between care groups in terms of their organizational and financial arrangements. These differences may result in variation in outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess whether variation in healthcare costs, diabetes complications and related hospital admissions on the level of care groups exist.
Methods
A quantitative cohort study was conducted. Patients who used diabetes medication (more than 180 days of defined daily doses per year) for the first time between the years 2014 and 2019 were included. Data were extracted from health insurance claims between 2014 and 2019. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse patient variation in healthcare costs (two and six years follow-up), diabetes-related complications and hospital admission days. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to estimate the amount of variation that was attributable to the care groups.
Results
A large variation in outcome variables was observed between patients and a small variation between care groups. The intraclass correlation coefficient for long-term costs was 0.4\%; for short-term costs between 0.1\% and 0.3\%; for complications 1\% and for hospital days 4\%.
Discussion
A large variation between patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 exists in terms of their healthcare costs and complications. In our study, care groups accounted minimally for this variation. A generalized linear mixed model in combination with year cohorts is a tool to study variations in the long-term outcomes of integrated care initiatives.},

	abstract = {Background
Third-variable effect refers to the effect from a third-variable that explains an observed relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Depending on whether there is a causal relationship from the exposure to the third variable, the third-variable is called a mediator or a confounder. The multilevel mediation analysis is used to differentiate third-variable effects from data of hierarchical structures.
Data Collection and Analysis
We developed a multilevel mediation analysis method to deal with time-to-event outcomes and implemented the method in the mlma R package. With the method, third-variable effects from different levels of data can be estimated. The method uses multilevel additive models that allow for transformations of variables to take into account potential nonlinear relationships among variables in the mediation analysis. We apply the proposed method to explore the racial/ethnic disparities in survival among patients diagnosed with breast cancer in California between 2006 and 2017, using both individual risk factors and census tract level environmental factors. The individual risk factors are collected by cancer registries and the census tract level factors are collected by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California in partnership with the Virginia Commonwealth University's Center on Society and Health. The National Cancer Institute work group linked variables at the census tract level with each patient and performed the analysis for this study.
Results
We found that the racial disparity in survival were mostly explained at the census tract level and partially explained at the individual level. The associations among variables were depicted. Conclusion: The multilevel mediation analysis method can be used to differentiate mediation/confounding effects for factors originated from different levels. The method is implemented in the R package mlma.},

A predominant approach has been to use linear structural equation models and examine the statistical significance of the corresponding path coefficients. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the multiple mechanisms are causally independent of one another. In this article, we consider a set of alternative assumptions that are sufficient to identify the average causal mediation effects when multiple, causally related mediators exist. We develop a new sensitivity analysis for examining the robustness of empirical findings to the potential violation of a key identification assumption. We apply the proposed methods to three political psychology experiments, which examine alternative causal pathways between media framing and public opinion. Our analysis reveals that the validity of original conclusions is highly reliant on the assumed independence of alternative causal mechanisms, highlighting the importance of proposed sensitivity analysis.

The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we ï¬rst prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identiï¬ed. We compare our identiï¬cation assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identiï¬cation result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical ï¬ndings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms.
          Methods:Â 
          ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by âtranslationâ of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physiciansâ assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms.
          Results:Â 
          Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm.
          Conclusions:Â 
          These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

In many scientiï¬c disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal eï¬ects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally aï¬ects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation eï¬ects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under diï¬erent experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also oï¬ers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.},

	abstract = {With the continued increase in the use of Bayesian methods in drug development, there is a need for statisticians to have tools to develop robust and defensible informative prior distributions. Whilst relevant empirical data should, where possible, provide the basis for such priors, it is often the case that limitations in data and/or our understanding may preclude direct construction of a data-based prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within GlaxoSmithKline, we have adopted a structured approach to prior elicitation on the basis of the SHELF elicitation framework and routinely use this in conjunction with calculation of probability of success (assurance) of the next study(s) to inform internal decision making at key project milestones. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences of embedding the use of prior elicitation within a large pharmaceutical company, highlighting both the benefits and challenges of prior elicitation through a series of case studies. We have found that putting team beliefs into the shape of a quantitative probability distribution provides a firm anchor for all internal decision making, enabling teams to provide investment boards with formally appropriate estimates of the probability of trial success as well as robust plans for interim decision rules where appropriate. As an added benefit, the elicitation process provides transparency about the beliefs and risks of the potential medicine, ultimately enabling better portfolio and company-wide decision making.},

Rapid methodologic developments in mediation analyses mean that there are a growing number of approaches for researchers to consider, each with its own set of assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages. This has understandably resulted in some confusion among applied researchers. Here, we provide a brief overview of the mediation methods available and discuss points for consideration when choosing a method. We provide an in-depth explication of 2 of the many potential estimators for illustrative purposes: the Baron and Kenny mediation approach, because it is the most commonly used, and a recently developed approach for estimating stochastic direct and indirect effects, because it relies on far fewer assumptions. We illustrate the decision process and analytical procedure by estimating potential school- and peer-based mechanisms linking neighborhood poverty to adolescent substance use in the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement.},

We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that, even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.},

	abstract = {Quantitative studies of racial health disparities often use static measures of self-reported race and conventional regression estimators, which critics argue is inconsistent with social-constructivist theories of race, racialization, and racism. We demonstrate an alternative counterfactual approach to explain how multiple racialized systems dynamically shape health over time, examining racial inequities in cardiometabolic risk in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. This framework accounts for the dynamics of time-varying confounding and mediation that is required in operationalizing a âraceâ variable as part of a social process (racism) rather than a separable, individual characteristic. We decompose the observed disparity into three types of effects: a controlled direct effect (âunobserved racismâ), proportions attributable to interaction (âracial discriminationâ), and pure indirect effects (âemergent discriminationâ). We discuss the limitations of counterfactual approaches while highlighting how they can be combined with critical theories to quantify how interlocking systems produce racial health inequities.},

New advancements in modern computation power have led to increasing interest in Bayesian methods. Despite the multiple benefits of Bayesian approaches, application to clinical trials has been limited. Based on insights from the survey of clinical researchers in drug development conducted by the Drug Information Association Bayesian Scientific Working Group (DIA BSWG), insufficient knowledge of Bayesian approaches was ranked as the most important perceived barrier to implementing Bayesian methods. Results of the same survey indicate that clinical researchers may find the interpretation of results from a Bayesian analysis to be more useful than conventional interpretations. In this article, we illustrate key concepts tied to Bayesian methods, starting with familiar concepts widely used in clinical practice before advancing in complexity, and use practical illustrations from clinical development.},

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to selection bias that is not ruled out by the parallel trends assumption. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001â2007.

The study included 71 VA primary care sites serving rural veterans. Participants were adult veterans who received primary care services from a site enrolled in the program and who received inpatient hospital care. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to August 2022.The PACT staffing program was a clinic-level intervention that provided 3-year seed funding to Veterans Health Administration medical centers to hire 1 or more additional social workers in primary care teams. Staggered timing of the intervention enabled comparison of mean outcomes across sites before and after the intervention.The primary outcome was the number of individuals per 1000 veterans who had any palliative care use in 30 days after an inpatient hospital stay.The analytic sample included 43â¯200 veterans (mean [SD] age, 65.34 [13.95] years; 37â¯259 [86.25\%] men) and a total of 91â¯675 episodes of inpatient hospital care. Among the total cohort, 8611 veterans (9.39\%) were Black, 77â¯069 veterans (84.07\%) were White, and 2679 veterans (2.92\%) were another race (including American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander). A mean of 14.5 individuals per 1000 veterans (1329 individuals in all) used palliative care after a hospital stay. After the intervention, there was an increase of 15.6 (95\% CI, 9.2-22.3) individuals per 1000 veterans using palliative or hospice care after a hospital stay, controlling for national time trends and veteran characteristicsâa 2-fold difference relative to the mean.This cohort study found significant increases in use of palliative care for recently hospitalized veterans whose primary care team had additional social work staffing. These findings suggest that social workers may increase access to and/or use of palliative care. Future work should assess the mechanism for this association and whether the increase in palliative care is associated with other health or health care outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Medicaid expansion (ME) has contributed to transforming the United States healthcare system. However, its effect on palliative care of primary liver cancers remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the association between ME and the receipt of palliative treatment in advanced-stage liver cancer.
Methods
Patients diagnosed with stage IV hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were identified from the National Cancer Database and divided into pre-expansion (2010-2013) and postexpansion (2015-2019) cohorts. Logistic regression identified predictors of palliative treatment. Difference-in-difference (DID) analysis assessed changes in palliative care use between patients living in ME states and patients living in non-ME states.
Results
Among 12,516 patients, 4582 (36.6\%) were diagnosed before expansion, and 7934 (63.6\%) were diagnosed after expansion. Overall, rates of palliative treatment increased after ME (18.1\% [pre-expansion] vs 22.3\% [postexpansion]; PÂ {\textless}Â .001) and are more pronounced among ME states. Before expansion, only cancer type and education attainment were associated with the receipt of palliative treatment. Conversely, after expansion, race, insurance, location, cancer type, and ME status (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.44; PÂ =Â .018) were all associated with palliative care. Interestingly, the odds were higher if treatment involved receipt of pain management (OR, 2.05; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.43; PÂ =Â .006). Adjusted DID analysis confirmed increased rates of palliative treatment among patients living in ME states relative to non-ME states (DID, 4.4\%; 95\% CI, 1.2-7.7; PÂ =Â .008); however, racial disparities persist (White, 5.6; 95\% CI, 1.4-9.8; PÂ =Â .009; minority, 2.6; 95\% CI, â2.5 to 7.6; PÂ =Â .333).
Conclusion
The implementation of ME contributed to increased rates of palliative treatment for patients residing in ME states after expansion. However, racial disparities persist even after ME, resulting in inequitable access to palliative care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether implementation of hospital-based palliative care services is associated with decreased intensive care unit (ICU) use during terminal hospitalizations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included 51 hospitals in New York State that either did or did not implement a palliative care program between 2008 and 2014. Hospitals that consistently had a palliative care program during the study period were excluded. Participants were adult patients who died during hospitalization. Data analysis was performed between January 2018 and July 2019. EXPOSURE Implementation of a palliative care program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was ICU use. A difference-in-differences analysis was performed using multilevel regression to assess the association between implementing a palliative care program and ICU use during terminal hospitalizations while adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and time trends.
RESULTS During the study period, 73 370 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.5 [14.1] years; 38 467 [52.4\%] women) died during hospitalization, of whom 37 628 (51.3\%) received care in hospitals that implemented palliative care services and 35 742 (48.7\%) received care in a hospital without palliative care implementation. Patients who received care in hospitals after implementation of palliative care services were less likely to receive intensive care than patients admitted to the same hospitals before implementation (49.3\% vs 52.8\%; difference 3.5\%; 95\% CI, 2.5\%-4.5\%; P {\textless} .001). Compared with hospitals that never had a palliative care program, the implementation of palliative care was associated with a 10\% reduction in ICU use during terminal hospitalizations (adjusted relative risk, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.85-0.95; P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implementation of hospital-based palliative care services in New York State was associated with a modest reduction in ICU use during terminal hospitalizations.},

	abstract = {The difference in difference (DID) design is a quasi-experimental research design that researchers often use to study causal relationships in public health settings where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are infeasible or unethical. However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method\&apos;s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

This paper introduces marginal structural models, a new class of causal models that allow for improved adjustment of confounding in those situations. The parameters of a marginal structural model can be consistently estimated using a new class of estimators, the inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators.},

To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after the rise in the minimum. Comparisons of the changes in wages, employment, and prices at stores in New Jersey relative to stores in Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage remained fixed at \$4.25 per hour) yield simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. Our empirical findings challenge the prediction that a rise in the minimum reduces employment. Relative to stores in Pennsylvania, fast food restaurants in New Jersey increased employment by 13 percent. We also compare employment growth at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (and were unaffected by the new law) to employment changes at lower-wage stores. Stores that were unaffected by the minimum wage had the same employment growth as stores in Pennsylvania, while stores that had to increase their wages increased their employment.},
