Therefore, cohen's d is interpreted in units of standard deviation.\\\n-   drop out rates\n\nOther information to consider for survival analyses:\n\n-   rate of enrollment\\\n-   length of study\\\n-   hazard rate of each group\n\n## T-test designs and sample size calculations\n\nWe will be using the *pwr* package. To start, let's estimate a sample size with:\n\n-   alpha = 0.05\\\n-   power = 0.80 (1-$\\beta$)\\\n-   effect size, cohen's d = 0.5, which is considered a moderate effect size\n\n```{r pwr t test two sample}\npwr::pwr.t.test(sig.level=0.05,type=\"two.sample\",power=.8,d=.5)\n\n```\n\n**Key result: 64 volunteers per arm.** We round up because there can be no fractional individuals.\n\nFor a different study design, let's assume there is a before and after measurement of a continuous variable and this would produce paired results with the same assumptions about $\\alpha$,$\\beta$, and cohen's d.\n\n```{r pwr paired t-test}\npwr::pwr.t.test(sig.level=0.05,type=\"paired\",power=.8,d=.5)\n```\n\n**Key result: 34 volunteers per arm.**\n\nWe also may need to consider drop out rates. For example, if there is a 20% drop out rate, then add 20% to the sample sizes per arm. 34 x 20% = \\~7, so we would need 41 volunteers.\n\n### Simulating effect sizes and power\n\nWhat if we don't know the effect size and want to find out sample sizes based on different inputs of effect size and power?\n\n-   simulating effect sizes from 0 to 2 in .1 increments\\\n-   over two levels of power (0.8 and .9)\n\n```{r simulate t.test effsize power}\n#code to get sample size from pwr.t.test\n#round(pwr::pwr.t.test(sig.level=0.05,type=\"two.sample\",power=.8,d=c(.5),n=NULL)$n,0)\n\nd<-data.frame(efsize=rep(seq(0.1,2,.1),2),\n              power=c(rep(.8,length(seq(0.1,2,.1))),\n                      rep(.9,length(seq(0.1,2,.1)))))\nd%>%\n  group_by(efsize,power)%>%\n  mutate(n=round(pwr::pwr.t.test(sig.level=0.05,\n                                 type=\"two.sample\",power=power,\n                                 d=efsize,n=NULL)$n,0),\n         power2=paste(\"Power = \",power,sep=\"\"))%>%\n  #power2 is for plotting\n  ggplot(.,aes(x=efsize,y=n,colour=factor(power)))+\n  geom_point()+geom_line()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  geom_text(aes(label=n),vjust=-1)+\n  facet_wrap(~power2,ncol=1)+\n  xlab(\"Effect size (cohen's d)\")+\n  ylab(\"Sample size per arm\")+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(,limits=c(0,2)\n                     ,breaks=seq(0,2,.25),\n                     labels=seq(0,2,.25))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,2500))\n\n```\n\n## Chi-square 2x2 contingency table design\n\nIn this design, let's say there are counts of diseased and not-diseased individuals that were exposed and not exposed to some chemical. We want to find the association between the two variables and we need to specify the expected proportions of the 2x2 under the alternative hypothesis.\n\n```{r chisquare design}\n#ES.w2() # chi-square for test of association\n#pwr.chisq.test()\n\nd2<-data.frame(exposure=c(\"exposed\",\"not exposed\"),non_diseased=c(.25,.3),diseased=c(0.25,.2))\nknitr::kable(d2)\n```\n\nNow that we have the expected 2x2 matrix under the alternative hypothesis (not independent), then we need to identify the effect size with *ES.w2()* and then plug and chug with *pwr.chisq.test()* with $\\alpha$ = 0.05 and power = 0.8.\n\n```{r chisquare power analysis}\nef.sim.dat<-ES.w2(d2[,-1])\npwr.chisq.test(w=ef.sim.dat,df=1,power=.8,sig.level=.05)\n```\n\n**Key result: We need 778 observations.** Note that the degrees of freedom on 1 in this case for a 2x2 contingency table, which is calculated as (\\# of columns - 1) x (\\# of rows -1).\n\n## Time to event types of designs (survival analyses)\n\nI will be using the *gsDesign* package and referencing an online resource [**here**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gsDesign/vignettes/SurvivalOverview.html).\n\n```{r}\n\nhr=.7 # hazard ratio\ncontrolMedian<-8 # 8 months\nlambda1 <- log(2) / controlMedian #estimated hazard rate of control\n\nnSurvival(\n  lambda1 = lambda1,\n  lambda2 = lambda1 * hr, #hazard rate for experimental\n  Ts = 24, #24 months\n  Tr = 6, # 6 months\n  eta = .1, # value per month dropout rate\n  ratio = 1, # equal sampling\n  alpha = .05,\n  beta = .2\n)\n\n\n```\n\n# Randomization (stratified permuted block randomization)\n\nUsing the t-test design (2 trial arms), we'd like to implement block randomization across a strata. Often times, we can't sample participants all at once and so we need to apply treatments in groupings as they enroll in the study, or blocks. To ensure equal sampling of treatments across different sub-populations, randomization can be conducted at the level of different sub-populations (strata). For example, randomization can be conducted for males and females separately. With a sample size of 200 per arm, in a two-arm trial, I'm randomization across a gender strata (100 each so they're equally sampled).\n\n## ...with *blockrand* package\n\n```{r stratified block randomization}\nmrand<-blockrand(n = 100, \n                     num.levels = 2, # three treatments\n                     levels = c(\"Con.Arm\", \"Treat.Arm\"), # arm names\n                     stratum = \"Strat.male\", # stratum name\n                     id.prefix = \"SM\", # stratum abbrev\n                     block.sizes = c(3,4), # times arms = 6,8\n                     block.prefix = \"blksm\") # stratum abbrev\n\nfrand<-blockrand(n = 100, \n                     num.levels = 2, # three treatments\n                     levels = c(\"Con.Arm\", \"Treat.Arm\"), # arm names\n                     stratum = \"Strat.female\", # stratum name\n                     id.prefix = \"SF\", # stratum abbrev\n                     block.sizes = c(3,4), # times arms = 6,8\n                     block.prefix = \"blkfm\") # stratum abbrev\ntotrand<-rbind(mrand,frand)\nknitr::kable(head(totrand,25))\n```\n\nWe can then create patient randomization \"cards\" based on the *blockrand()* output.\n\n```{r blockrand card pdf}\n\nplotblockrand(totrand,'mystudy.pdf',\n              top=list(text=c('MyStudy','Patient:%ID%','Treatment:%TREAT%'),\n                       col=c('black','black','red'),font=c(1,1,4)),\n              middle=list(text=c(\"MyStudy\",\"Sex:%STRAT%\",\"Patient:%ID%\"),\n                          col=c('black','blue','green'),font=c(1,2,3)),\n              bottom=\"Call123-4567toreportpatiententry\", cut.marks=TRUE)\n\n```\n\n## ...with *randomizeR* package\n\nUsing the randomized permuted block randomization function, *rpbrPar()*.
