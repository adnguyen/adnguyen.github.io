<h2>I don't do research in a vacuum, I'm supported by a whole scientific community.</h2>

<h3> Committee members </h3> 
Overseeing my scientific progress: <br>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~bllockwo/">Brent Lockwood, PhD, Assistant Professor </a>, studies the molecular basis of temperature adaptation.</li>
		<li><a href="http://jillpreston.weebly.com/">Jill Preston, PhD, Assistant Professor</a>, studies the molecular evolution of petal fusion and temperature adaptation.</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Colleagues for life! </h3>
<div class="blurb">
	My colleagues at UVM have enriched my scientific training and experience through the exchange of ideas and by teaching me different areas of biology. So I'd like to highlight their research here in no particular order. <br>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="">Mike Herrmann, PhD candidate</a> studies the evolution of communication in an unusual system of hybridizing harvester ants .</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cddambro/">Cristian Dambros, PhD</a> taught me a lot of stats and the forces that drive termite communities.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~adegrass/">Allyson Degrassi, PhD candidate</a> taught me how changing environments impact rodent communities.</li>
		<li><a href="https://flopezo.github.io/">Federico Lopez-Osorio, PhD candidate</a> constantly pushes me to think and approach biology with phylogenetic trees and it has changed my projects for the better!</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~nnasseri/Home.html">Nabil Nasseri, PhD candidate</a> opened my eyes to the beauty of multispecies interactions, specifically ant-hemipteran mutualisms and their effects on arthropod communities.</li>
		<li><a href="https://katieamiller.wordpress.com/">Katie Ann Miller, PhD student</a> showed me cool patterns of ant nutritional demands along a climate gradient. </li>
		<li><a href="">Samantha Alger, PhD candidate</a> introduced me to how viruses hop between bee species when feeding on flowers! </li>
		<li><a href="">Yainna Hernaiz Hernandez, MS</a> found that harvester ants get infected by diverse fungal pathogens. </li>
		<li><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/?Page=students/weir.php&SM=facultysubmenu.html">Marion Weir, PhD candidate</a> uncovered molecular mechanisms underlying cell movements, which is important for understanding cancer progression.</li>
		<li><a href="">Lucia Orantes, PhD candidate</a> seeks to find how Chagas disease spreads in South America.</li>
	</ul>
