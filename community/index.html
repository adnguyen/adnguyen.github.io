<h2>Colleagues for life! <h2>
My colleagues at UVM enriched my scientific training and experience by teaching me about different areas of biology and how they approached their research. So I'd like to highlight their research here. <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cddambro/">Cristian Dambros, PhD</a> taught me a lot of stats and community ecology.<br>

<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~adegrass/">Allyson Degrassi, PhD candidate</a> taught me how changing environments impact rodent communities.<br>

<a href="https://flopezo.github.io/">Federico Lopez-Osorio, PhD candidate</a> constantly pushes me to think and approach biology with phylogenetic trees and it has changed my projects for the better!<br>

<a href="">Nabil Nasseri, PhD candidate</a> opened my eyes to the beauty of multispecies interactions, specifically ant-hemipteran mutualisms.<br>

<a href="https://katieamiller.wordpress.com/">Katie Ann Miller, PhD student</a> showed me cool patterns of ant nutritional demands along a climate gradient. <br>
