<h2>Colleagues for life! <h2>
<div class="blurb">
	My colleagues at UVM enriched my scientific training and experience by teaching me about different areas of biology. So I'd like to highlight their research here. <br>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cddambro/">Cristian Dambros, PhD</a> taught me a lot of stats and community ecology.</li>

		<li><a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~adegrass/">Allyson Degrassi, PhD candidate</a> taught me how changing environments impact rodent communities.</li>

		<li><a href="https://flopezo.github.io/">Federico Lopez-Osorio, PhD candidate</a> constantly pushes me to think and approach biology with phylogenetic trees and it has changed my projects for the better!</li>

		<li><a href="">Nabil Nasseri, PhD candidate</a> opened my eyes to the beauty of multispecies interactions, specifically ant-hemipteran mutualisms.</li>

		<li><a href="https://katieamiller.wordpress.com/">Katie Ann Miller, PhD student</a> showed me cool patterns of ant nutritional demands along a climate gradient. </li>
	</ul>
