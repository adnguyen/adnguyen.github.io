Unfortunately, I was not awarded the NSF <a href="http://adnguyen.github.io/blog/2015/10/07/DDIG">DDIG</a>. Here are the reviews for my proposal:

1. <a href="/assets/2016_DDIG_panel_summary.pdf">panel summary</a>
2. <a href="/assets/2016_DDIG_review1.pdf">reviewer #1</a>
3. <a href="/assets/2016_DDIG_review2.pdf">reviewer #2</a>
4. <a href="/assets/2016_DDIG_review3.pdf">reviewer #3</a>

What I've learned: Life is not fair. Reviewers 1 + 2 really have no clue and probably didn't read my proposal. 

For my reference, here are my quick and dirty ideas to improve the proposal:
*Beef up broader impacts     
*Make a better connection between Hsps and protein stability because reviewer 1+2 has no clue and same with the panel summary.     
*Needed more mass spec methods such as analyzing m/z profiles     
*Preliminary data would have gone a long wayâ€¦     
*added more natural history such as deciduous forest species moving nests around a lot more and flat wood species being more static so that there is an a priori expectation that there are physiological differences. This would address the behavioral component in the panel summary. But did they even look at the Ctmax data because they kept saying cline.
