title: "What is an evolutionary physiologist?"

A professor once pressed me to label my field of research. This allows for other biologists to get a feel for what you do. I had a few thoughts initially:   

* molecular ecologist-This is a bottom-up label and I like thinking top-down.    
* evolutionary biologist-Too broad.
* comparative physiologist-The word comparative doesn't quite sit well with me.
* Evolutionary ecologist-Not really..
* Physiological ecologist-I don't think I do enough field research...


After some time brewing about my label, I decided to do a literature search and found this cool publication by <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/221735?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Feder et al. 2000 </a>, which my work neatly falls under! These authors describe an 'evolutionary physiologist' by the questions asked and research approach. Evolutionary physiologists ask:    

1. How have physiological traits evolved among species?[Check] 
2. What factors have shaped the evolution of physiological traits(at the big and small phenotypic levels)?[Check] 
3. How do different levels of biological organization in physiological traits ultimately interact to influence fitness?  

And the research approach to answer these questions includes tools from diverse disciplines such as phylogenetics [check], field collections [check], field studies, common garden experiments [check], selection experiments, genetics, and molecular techniques [check]. 

Now, I don't do all of these things, but this paper provides the framework for me to explore and expand different aspects within the field.
