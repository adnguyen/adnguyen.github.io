A professor once pressed me to label my field of research. This allows for other biologists to get a feel for what you do. I had a few thoughts initially:   

* Molecular ecologist-This is a bottom-up label and I like thinking top-down.    
* Evolutionary biologist-Too broad.
* Comparative physiologist-I'm unsure of the word comparative.
* Evolutionary ecologist-I don't know if I'd brand myself an ecologist. 
* Physiological ecologist-I don't think I do enough field research...


After some time brewing about my label, I decided to do a literature search and found this cool publication by <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/221735?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Feder et al. 2000 </a>, which my work neatly falls under!
