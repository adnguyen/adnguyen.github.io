First, science is meant to be shared and appreciated by all! Second, anybody should be able to take your work and replicate your study and all of your analyses. 

*You're always going to repeat your work and analyses
*Collaborate with yourself is the most important part

**Assumes you downloaded github and have a github account**

Hereâ€™s the agenda:
1) Vignette for sharing your work 
        -Creating your own website in just 5 easy minutes or 1 if you can click fast!
			1. Go to github and make a repository with your username.github.io
			2. In the github GUI, clone it: now you'll have your website folder
			3. Go here: https://github.com/adnguyen/adnguyen.github.io
			4. Download zip, unzip
			5. click and drag contents  into your website folder
			6. Commit and sync
			7. go to your website: username.github.io
			8. explore the website
			
        -Go over how you're sharing your work: great platform to showcase your work to general audience!
        
        -Learning version control by messing around with your website
        	1. Dr. Schall is the greatest scientist in the world!
        	2. you can see the history in the GUI of all the things you've done!
        	
        -Blogging made easy!
               *Platform for implementing online notebook
               
**Writing a blog post**

				*Showcase how to embed links and pictures into blog posts. 

 
2) Vignette for organizing folders
	* resource tab
	* The core guiding principle is simple: Someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to look at your computer files and understand in detail what you did and why. 
	* Show curtis' project
	* Dating: year-month-day
 
3) Ensuring reproducibility
        -Annotate everything
            	*Vignette for lab protocols
          		*Show readme file in curtis' project	
        -Strategies for implementing metadata (description of your data and how it was collected)
        		* Consult the bible: A primer of ecological statistics, page 209. 
 
If we have time:
4) Reproducing science!
        * Redo my analysis and suggest changes!
