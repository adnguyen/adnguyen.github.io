### Sampling: Collected ants from FL to Maine

In total, we sampled ~100 ant colonies (Aphaenogaster) and reared them in lab acclimated conditions (25C). 
Then we assessed high temperature tolerance (CTmax) by slowing heating these ants up at 0.1C/min in a circulating water bath. 


### We uncovered evolutionary innovations in coping with high temperature stress.

CTmax is mapped back onto a phylogeny. The phylogenetic reconstruction was performed on a ~174,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) character matrix using RAxML. 

## Next we asked: How does the stress response follow these patterns of adaptive variation?

We quantified the stress response (see y axis in left panel), measured as _Hsp70_ gene expression under the same slow ramping experiment as above. We fit a boltzmann function to these curves and estimated 3 key parts of the curve: Tm or critical temperature, slope, and max expression.
