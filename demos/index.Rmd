[Back to main page](https://adnguyen.github.io/)

This page demos codes that I've worked on over the years. I enjoy learning difference analyses and interesting ways to show results. 

I hope this page will serve as a useful reference! Across all scripts, I show the libraries I've loaded and output the sessioninfo to facilitate reproducibility. 

### Data visualization and statistics in R:     

* Plotting figures with [ggplot](ggplot.html): barplots, scatter plots, multi-panels  

* Demos for maps:      
    * [Demo](RasterPCA_demo.html) for making maps in R and performing PCA on climate rasters with *rasterPCA()*       
    * [Grabbing land cover data](20160219_grabbing_land_cover_data.html)     * [Grabbing tree canopy cover](2017-03-06_tree_cover.html)    
    * Make interactive maps with [leaflet](Leaflet_code.html)

* Cool project where we asked whether ants were stressed under experimental [warming](20170508_stressed_ants_report_forSHC_NJG.html)  
    * Script starts from calculating log2 fold change in gene expression to statistical models to predicting stress back out into nature.   

* My review of [1-way ANOVA](20170601_ANOVA_vignette.html): calculating sums of squares.

### Function-valued traits  

* Diapause exit as a function valued trait: [Plotting parameters of diapause termination](2018-01-10_phases_of_diapause_exit.html)
* Gene expression as function-valued trait demo: [Fitting boltzmann curve to transcript abundance dataset](Function_valued_traits.html)    
* Proteins unfolding as a function valued trait: [Fitting unfolding curves](20170411_prelim_analyses_pog_aph_proteomics.html)      
    * Messing around with unfolding parameters and interpretting their biological significance: [Unfolding curve parameter tweaks](2020-03-12_unfolding_curves.html)    
* Evaluating evolutionary responses to selection of performance curves. [Simulating Data for clones and their performance curves, estimating G, and decomposing the variation in G](2018-01-10_simulate_perf_curves.html)

### Reasoning with Uncertainty   

* My [shinyapp](https://antdrewdnguyen.shinyapps.io/dempster_shafer/) for binary classification using Dempster-Shafer Theory, accounting for model uncertainty.
