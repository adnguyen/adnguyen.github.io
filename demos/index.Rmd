[Back to main page](https://adnguyen.github.io/)

This page demos codes that I've worked on over the years. I enjoy learning difference analyses and interesting ways to show results. 

I hope this page will serve as a useful reference! Across all scripts, I show the libraries I've loaded and output the sessioninfo to facilitate reproducibility. 



### Data visualization and statistics in R:     

* [Demo'ing tidyverse](ggplot.html) starting from a fruit fly dataset to publication quality figures
  * barplots, cumulative density plots, scatterplots, multi-panel plots in ggplot2    
  * Survival analysis and machine learning with SVM    

* Demos for maps:      
    * [Demo](RasterPCA_demo.html) for making maps in R and performing PCA on climate rasters with *rasterPCA()*       
    * Make interactive maps with [leaflet](Leaflet_code.html)

### Independent [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) Projects:    
* Stroke Prediction [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?resource=download), [exploratory analyses](stroke.pdf)   


### Reasoning with Uncertainty:   

* My [shinyapp](https://antdrewdnguyen.shinyapps.io/dempster_shafer/) for binary classification using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). This specific use case of DST accounts for model uncertainty for predictions and then combining different sources of evidence. 


### Unpublished projects:   

* Surveyed ants for gene expression exposed to [experimental warming in nature](20170508_stressed_ants_report_forSHC_NJG.html)  
    * Script starts from calculating log2 fold change in gene expression to statistical models to predicting stress back out into nature.   


### Simulations: traits as functions   

* Evaluating evolutionary responses to selection of performance curves using statistical genetics approaches by Joel Kingsolver. [Simulating Data for clones and their performance curves, estimating G, and decomposing the variation in G](2018-01-10_simulate_perf_curves.html)  
* Diapause exit as a function valued trait: [Plotting parameters of diapause termination](2018-01-10_phases_of_diapause_exit.html)
* Gene expression as function-valued trait demo: [Fitting boltzmann curve to transcript abundance dataset](Function_valued_traits.html)    
* Proteins unfolding as a function valued trait: [Fitting unfolding curves](20170411_prelim_analyses_pog_aph_proteomics.html)      
    * Simulating unfolding parameters and interpreting their biological significance: [Unfolding curve parameter tweaks](2020-03-12_unfolding_curves.html)
