# Introduction -> Goals   

In this demo, I become more familiar with interacting with SQL databases. I'll be following a tutorial from **[data carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/05-r-and-databases.html)**, but I'd also like to peruse open databases to become more versed in SQL and querying databases into R for data wrangling and analyses. Lastly, I'll construct my own databases from datasets I have generated.    

# Load Libraries

```{r load libaries, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(RSQLite) # SQL - R package
library(dbplyr) # SQL - R package, lets dplyr apply to
#SQL databases
```

# The database - Portal Mammals Database

I have to first download the portal mammals database off of figshare. Then, load the mammals database.

```{r portal mammals database}
#download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292171",
#              destfile = "data/portal_mammals.sqlite", mode = "wb")
# load data
mammals<-DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/portal_mammals.sqlite")
#This command does not load the data into the R session
#(as the read_csv() function did). 
#Instead, it instructs R 
#to connect to the SQLite database
#contained in the portal_mammals.sqlite file.

#now, lets see what the database is made of
src_dbi(mammals)

## querying database with tbl
tbl(mammals, sql("SELECT year, species_id, plot_id FROM surveys"))

surveys <- tbl(mammals, "surveys")
surveys %>%
    select(year, species_id, plot_id)

show_query(head(surveys, n = 10))

surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
##R is lazy and doesn't read in data until specified
# using collect to read in the data into R
data_subset <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight) %>%
  collect()
data_subset

```



# SessionInfo

```{r session info}
sessionInfo()

```
